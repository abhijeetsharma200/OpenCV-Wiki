* Last progress before 2-week end-of-year break

### *__Minutes__*
* Intel team
   * OpenCV 4.5.1 and 3.4.13 have been released.
   * [answers.opencv.org](https://answers.opencv.org/questions/) is read-only now. Activity on [forum.opencv.org](https://forum.opencv.org/) is where Q&A happens now.
   * The team has reviewed Euler Angles PR, left some comments ([https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/19098](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/19098))
   * Putting RGBD parts to 3D module is in progress
* **Org: Done:**
   * Anastasia: fixed issue #18878
   * Amir: worked on amendments to Voronoi diagram construction with respect to new topology (i.e. Delaunay triangulation) defined by the new predicates. PR #19126 is being reviewed.
   * Alexander: Implemented full RISC-V testing pipeline for OpenCV CN CI with QEMU emulator. Prepared test suppression list for major modules. 
      * Work on multi-core & multi-theading solution for RISC-V is in progress.
      * Implemented pre-commit pipeline for PR testing on Ubuntu 18.04. Work on ARM analogue is in progress.
      * Resolved several networking and security issues and exposed CI server to the Internet. CI master is available at https://build.opencv.org.cn/
      * Analyzed failed tests on CI, filed relevant bugs to Github. All issues are tracked in spreadsheet.
* **In progress:**
   * Anastasia: working on #19183
   * Amir: started with issue #4775
   * Igor: Working on opencv-python packages build speed up
   * Alexander: CI job for PR testing on ARM
      * Read-only access for subset of jobs on CI: pre-commit, nightly.
      * General infrastructure-related tasks for China CI: notifications, backup, etc
* Vadim in Shenzhen 

_In case we skip the meeting next week: Merry Christmas and Happy New Year everyone! Hope 2021 will be a beautiful and uneventful year unlike 2020_  ðŸ˜„

## __*Agenda*__
* OpenCV 4.5.1 / 3.4.13 release.
   * target release date: Dec 20-25
   * wiki: changelog
* GSOC blogposts
* OpenCV fails tests on ARM64, module : GAPI. Issues ## 19117..19124.
* ARM tests tolerance check adjustment (put under #if condition)
* China CI integration


### *__Minutes__*
* Release expected on time. AI to all: add notes to changelog.
* AI to all GSoC 2020 maintainers: ping students. Blog post about GSoC project is required. Lydia will contact to RISC-V case author and Depth Fusion
* G-API tests fail on ARM64. Alexander Alekhin reproduced a significant part of tests. The issue is treated as a non-accurate test implementation, but not a library issue. Alexander Smorkalov disables G-API on ARM64.
* Alexander Smorkalov works on OpenCV China CI and stabilizes base builds. A soon as they are stable, Alexander will work on

### *__Minutes__*

* Vadim:
   * got back to China successfully. On the quarantine currently.
   * working on OE34 (named parameters), since it may affect a lot of OpenCV 5.x API. Stub solution for Python, Java, JS is ready. Now working on a good solution for Python.
   * Prepared PR 19082 with RISC-V copyright info, but it causes some confusion. It's now being resolved and the updated patch will be prepared shortly.
* Anna:
   * new person (Amir) joined the team. Working on fixing Delaunay triangulation in one corner case (#19126)
   * Alexander is working on a number of PRs. ARM64 issue has been filed.
   * He is also working on OpenCV China CI.
   * Nearest-neighbor resize alignment is another topic.
   * Python bindings is in progress.
   * RISC-V build preparation is in progress.
* Gary:
   * AprilTag: did not have meeting past week. Sent a bunch of datasets to the student for proper testing.
   * Want to take a look at color calibration, contributed by H inc.
   * OpenCV.org is unrolling; OpenCV trademark etc.
   * Negotiating possibility to "hire" expert to implement state-of-art bundle adjustment for OpenCV; self-calibration is another possible topic.
   * OpenCV board meetings need to be resumed. The nearest one is planned at the end of 2020.
* Alexander:
   * A. Alekhin is working on adding versioning to videoio plugings (ffmpeg etc.)
   * Closed 300 invalid/obsolete issues.

   * Rostislav is moving some functionality from rgbd to 3d; reviewing PR with dual quaternions. 
   * Text recognition GSoC project results have been merged
* Shiqi:
   * helped to resolve issue with RISC-V related copyrights
   * installed fresh NVidia drivers on OpenCV China CI build nodes
