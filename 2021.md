### *__Minutes__*
*  1. GSoC 2021 Google Group was created 
*  2. Master RISC-V: [#18394](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/18394) -- Alternative universal intrinsics implementation for RISC-V with RVV 0.7 from THead for their hardware. Will be adjusted and merged later.

### *__Minutes__*
* 1. Feature freeze happened. The official release is targeted at the end of the month.
* 2. OpenCV team will change the branching strategy for the 5.0 release. Rationale: major branches rename breaks a lot of links, including documentation. The goal is to create new major branches and not rename existing ones.
   * a. Master will be renamed to 4.x
   * b. Next will be renamed to 5.x
   * c. No master branch
   * d. Default branch - 5.x
   * e. 6.x will be created for the next major version.
* 3. Proposals for GSoC 2021 are partly approval 
* 4. Jenkins: Xperience AI switched to new networking solution. PRs statuses will be stabilized in a couple of days.
* 5. PRs & Issues:
   * a. Bayer issues: #19629 #18619 #4857
      * i. Deprecate current constants and create new one in 4.x and next
      * ii. AI to Vadim Pisarevsky to work on it.
   * b. Android Camera through NDK ( #19597 )
      * i. Requires minimal supported Android version upgrade.
      * ii. OpenCV team will continue to release OpenCV for Android SDK with conservative strategy with minimal Android version. Native Camera support will not be there. Advanced users can build OpenCV with higher API level and Camera support by their own.
