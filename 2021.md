### *__Minutes__*

* Vadim:
  * All the students evaluations are in. This week the mentors review the students' work.
  * Yuantao F from OpenCV China has prepared a draft version of opencv_zoo (the model zoo) together with an early draft of the benchmark - script that measures inference speed on a set of models and some tiny dataset on the specified hardware and reports the results.
  * My GSoC student, Jebastin Nadar, has nearly completed the project on DNN 8-bit quantization. One PR is merged, another one is pending. The final expected result is the tutorial — how to quantize ONNX networks and how to load and use the quantized networks within ONNX.
* Anna:
  * Reviewing OpenCV AI competition submissions (there are many of them: ~150). Going to give a talk with overview of the competition itself and some notable submissions.
  * **Done:**
  * Alexander P: PR “Update kalman sample”, issue #20091: merged
  * Alexander P: “cv2.stereoCalibrate behaves differently to c++ implementation”, issue #517: the reproducer is received. User error found. Right way to use the function was recommended.
  * Alexander P: “Different shape of result of the method HOUGH_GRADIENT_ALT in Python”, issue #19238:
found and fixed bug (cvMat with different dimensions were copied to OutputArray _circles)
created tests, created and merge PR #20584
  * Alexander P: cv2.HoughLinesP does not filter correctly lines according the minLineLength #10823: user error found. Right way to use the function was recommended.
  * Andrey: Changed the way how dnn models are used in OpenCV CN CI pipelines. PR with changes.
  * Alexander S: reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with PR #20564, 20556, 20471, 20521, 20598
  * Alexander S: Prepared team scope for the current sprint
  * Egor: Split partial sum PR merged; ONNXImporter diagnostic mode layer registration PR merged.
  * **In progress:**
  * Alexander P: issue #18412 “SystemError: <built-in function NMSBoxes>”: The reproducer is received. Python binding errors found.   Temporary way to use the function was recommended. The error fix is being prepared.
  * Alexander P: issue #11085 “Python fisheye.stereoCalibrate: Assertion failed objectPoints.type()”: The example is partially reproduced. I am trying to reproduce the whole example.
  * Lydia: talked to one of GSoC-21 students (Ricardo Antunes) about blog post, set up the publishing date 
  * Egor: waiting for review of hasDynamicShapes and axis selection in Scale layer fix
  * Egor: Added Normalize subgraph, support for starts<0 and axis<0 in Slice, Mul broadcasting in the middle and fixed Expand's unsqueeze and sent a PR
* Alexander:
   * cv.mat fix (#19091) which Aleksandr Alekhin is working on has been tested via speech recognition GSoC project. The student who is working on GSoC speech recognition project tested this patch — works well.
   * GSoC:
      * Intrinsics tutorial is considered by Vitaly as finished. PR is on review.
      * Loop closure project of Zihao Mu: should pass the final evaluation, report:    https://gist.github.com/zihaomu/4933dd1fb805cbb684e2b407e1e87e51
      * Loop Closure code is done, supports HF-Net through OpenVINO (high quality) or DeepLCD through OpenCV DNN (low/middle quality) +  ORB feature detector.
      * Things left: to find or to film an outdoor video to demonstrate better DeepLCD quality.
      * Loop closure project of Justin Wu: DBoW PR is done but no Loop Closure code itself. It could be integrated to Zihao's code. You gave him one/two weeks to finish.
      * Speech recognition project: the sample is ready. Student is preparing a video clip and a report.
* Gary:
   * continue looking for more OpenCV funding.
   * lidars are getting quite affordable, e.g.: https://www.cygbot.com/2d-3d-dual-solid-state-tof-lidar
* Shiqi:
   * GSoC project on 3D samples has been evaluated. The results are excellent.
   * Talked to one prof. There is an idea to make another "OpenCV development board" with ARM+NPU, e.g. something similar to this: https://en.t-firefly.com/product/industry/rocrk3568pc.html
* Vincent:
   * porting to the latest OpenCV (4.5.x) is in progress.
   * found some possible data races, if confirmed, a bug will be filed.

* 5.0:
   * Moving RGBD parts to 3d ([#20013](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/20013)/ [contrib#2936](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/pull/2936)) -- will be merged today.
* PR & issues:
   * load point cloud in 3d module ([#20471](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/20471)) - should go to 3d module,but not new model
   * python: cv.Mat wrapper over numpy.ndarray ([#20558](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/20558)) -- will discuss next time. AI to all review the patch and all related issues to have context for the discussion.
   * 8-bit quantization in dnn module and int8 layers ([#20228](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/20228))
      * Vadim Pisarevsky will work on review issues
      * Current implementation fails tests time to time. AR to Vadim: Fix Precommits: "Linux AVX2", "Linux32", "Win32"
   * Runtime nlanes for SVE enablement #20562
      * complete results are required
      * Need to bring all technical discussions form e-mail thread to Github PR
      * Need clear technical statement in the PR: why and how it works.
      * Alexander & Alexander are against all related functions modification without actual add-value. Proposed alternative: add extra fields to the basic structures, if it’s required. Then propose RVV/SVE2/whatever backend to OpenCV. Then enable new options for functions one by one with performance control on all supported devices.

* One of OpenCV Debian package maintainers joined in (Jochen Sprickerhof):
   * part of OpenCV is excluded because of possible licensing issues
   * PPA is one way to publish OpenCV packages, which is recommended, it's easier to do that for Ubuntu than for Debian
   * It would be nice to generate up-to-date usable pkg-config files for OpenCV during build
   * Maybe the version scheme in OpenCV needs to be revised to enforce binary compatibility between the patch releases
* Vadim:
   * GSoC: all the evaluations submitted; out of 12 projects 11 have passed mid-term evaluation.
   * GSoC student (Jebastin N) has added formal regression tests for the dynamically quantized networks and individual layers. Majority of the tests pass. After the tests are all green, the PR can be merged.
   * GSoC (DNN + RVV): convolution primitives are implemented now, the code is being tested.
   * Received Allwinner D1 dev boards with RISC-V + RVV 0.7.1, now the testing of RVV backend becomes more feasible.
* Shiqi:
   * No updates, Ricardo is on track with GSoC.
* Alexander:
   * workarounds in DNN module: 1. OpenCV did not support 1D mat, 2. the output must always to be FP32 (now solved).

* Maksim Shabunin will make announcement and OpenCV.org changes in the meantime.
* OpenCV 5.0
   * '3d' module depends on 'features2d'. That looks unusual for a common module. Will be discussed with Vadim next week.
   * Rositslav is working on 3d interface. He is on vacations this week.
* GSoC 2021
   * GSoC PR [#3006](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/pull/3006) contains LGPL code and will be rejected.
   * AI to all: add PRs and student evaluation status to GSoC tracking spreadsheet.
* PRs & Issues:
   * AArch64 semihosting: #20392 -- Alexander Alekhin will look at it next week.
   * Add read/write functions for features2d and normalize naming convention: #20367. Most of classes inherited from cv::Algorithm do not implement FileStorage operations. Decided that the PR is useful, but should be more conservative: do not change test parameters and xml/yaml.
   * Exception when destroyWindow is called on a non existing window: #20417. Alternative option - print warning.
   * Java: force using of 'Ptr<>' for OpenCV classes: #2034 - JFYI
   * Proposal: Drop Output and InputOutput arguments from Python bindings interfaces for OpenCV 5.x: #20418 -- will be discussed next time with Vadim Pisarevsky.
   * GTK vs VLFW for 3D -- need Vadim Pisarevsky for the discussion.
   * Message_lite.h support in DNN.
      * The option makes sense.
      * Need to re-generate C code from propobuf files with lite option. M.b. update protobuf.
      * Need do check compatibility with 3.4. Make sense to propose pr to master.

* Vadim:
   * GSoC: many of the evaluations are not submitted yet. The reminder will be sent.
   * GSoC student (Jebastin N) has tested a few dynamically quantized object/face detection networks (FP32=>INT8) and the results are quite satisfactory. The performance is on par with the existing implementation, can be improved further. That is, more than 50% of the project is done already.
   * GSoC 3D samples project: discussed the results and plans with the mentors and the students. The results are quite good so far.
   * Together with Zihao M. started working on implementation of some missing ONNX layers (Less, Greater, NonMaxSupression), fixed a bug in Split/Slice layer. Briefly reviewed Stackblur patch from Zihao.
   * Reviewed dnn_face module from Yuantao F.; the functionality will be submitted into opencv/objdetect module.
   * Continue conversation with T-head team on the RVV optimization approaches.
   * Improved efficiency and the coverage of OpenCV Ficus bindings, still working on it.
* Shiqi:
   * GSoC student has implemented 3D point cloud & mesh visualization. In the next half of project he will add new functionality, better stability etc.
* Alexander:
   * RGBD => 3D PR has been reviewed by the core team; it's being polished now.
   * Public CI is improved, in particular, OpenCL builds.
   * Intern Maria joined OpenCV team, will be working on algorithms and visualization of audio/speech processing.
* Anna:
   * working on several PR, including better diagnostics in TF importer
   * there are some issues found when trying to import to DNN some new topologies that relate to the order of channels. The issues are being investigated.
   * working on the new releases of OpenCV-Python
   * "Group" layer in DNN is being implemented
   * 3D format import/export functionality is under review.

* Vadim:
   * GSoC student (Jebastin N) continues work on OpenCV DNN 8-bit compute path. Most of the planned layers are finished. Submitted PR, which is now 'green'. Before it's merged, Jebastin is testing it now on some real object detection networks.
   * Another GSoC student, Zihao M., continues work on the loop closure algorithm (DNN-based), and also on stackblur, faster alternative to gaussian blur. The draft implementation of stackblur is ready, but it's currently a bit slower than GaussianBlur, at least on the moderate-size images & kernels.
   * Yuantao F. created draft version of DNN-based face detection module (will likely be transformed into a part of opencv_contrib/face module) and also started work on OpenCV model zoo. The face detection model, created by Shiqi Yu, is there already.
   * Investigating how to extend universal intrinsics to support variable-size vectors (which is important for RISC-V RVV and ARM's SVE2).
   * Still working on Ficus bindings for OpenCV; several functions have been manually wrapped. Plan to finish the basic version of the wrappers, including dnn + imgcodecs + highgui + videoio + parts of core & imgproc, by the end of this week.
* Shiqi:
   * GSoC student Ricardo finished the function to display pointcloud. Some features are to be added. PR will be submitted shortly.
* Alexander:
   * OpenCV community 4.5.3 has been released on Monday.
   * -openvino suffix was added to the binaries on Windows (with dldt support)
   * RGBD->3D PR is finally polished, and is ready for review.
   * the intern is working on improving Kinfu: colored version etc., GPU optimizations, documenting useful parts of the pipeline, e.g. ICP: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dbe/kinfu_icp.html
   * GSoC: univ. intrinsics tutorial PR was submitted.
   * GSoC: speech recognition PR is submitted. C++ vs Python deviation was investigated, the fix is being prepared.
   * GSoC: implementation of fast bag of words for loop closure detection is in progress.
* Anna:
   * Done:
      * Andrey: Prepared the PR with building packages on Mac M1 for opencv-python repository.
      * Andrey: Prepared pull requests with changes of submodules for OpenCV Releases (4.5.3 and 3.4.15) in opencv-python repository.
   * In progress:
      * Egor: Shape + StridedSlice + Pack + Reshape is a pattern which gets simplified if there is no config file provided for the set.   But I did and hence got stuck. Reimplemented only ExpandDims using new layer parameters for Reshape, initial test suggests that everything is working.
      * Egor: Debugging net from this issue and fixing diagnostic tool along the way.
   * xperience.ai team is thinking of building a subset of OpenCV.
* Gary:
   * need to make another OpenCV board meeting.
   * some conversations with PyTorch team on possible collaboration.
   * PR with the implementation of deltile algo should be submitted soon.
