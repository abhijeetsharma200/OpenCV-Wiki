### *__Minutes__*

* Gary:
   * Filed all the necessary forms for GSoC (payment info etc.)
   * Separating accounts because Carla is now in a different foundation, not OSVF.
   * Big plans on expanding OpenCV foundation (robotics area is of special interest)
   * In order to increase OpenCV team, need to go to the upper level.
* Vadim:
   * The GSoC projects have been announced. Contacted a few students. Other mentors are welcome to do it as well.
   * Built and tested OpenCV on RISC-V 0.7.1 (simulator). All the core tests pass successfully. Need to acquire some real RISC-V hardware.
   * xperience.ai guys tried to use ARM server from China CI for OpenCV Python — unsuccessfully, the connection to github is very unstable.
   * The work on Ficus 1.0 alpha is finished. But maybe postpone it a bit, create bindings for OpenCV first.
* Anna:
   * Need to buy a new ARM board to test OpenCV Python on ARM Linux.
   * Got another developer into OpenCV team, Igor. He is now working on fixing issues in some pending pull requests.
   * Andrey: Split workflow according to platforms in Github Actions.
   * Alexander: Updated OpenCV-Python readme and documentation pages after migration to OpenCV organization on Github
   * Alexander: Helped to resolve issues in OpenCV-Python repo ## 486, 472, 465, 457, 455
   * Alexander: Debugged several OpenCV-Python test issues with Andrey
   In progress:
     * Andrey: Fixing running tests in Github Actions for “3.4” branch on ubuntu and macos.
* Alexander:
   * Hardware acceleration pull request was merged last week. Now the data stays on GPU without being copied to CPU (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/19755)
   * Alexander is working on GTK+ backend.
   * Rostislav will mentor another 3D (loop closure project) out of GSoC.
* Shiqi:
   * Contacted GSoC student on the 3D samples project. Suggested to sync efforts, because we will have 2 projects on the same topic.
   * Yuantao is defending Master thesis this week, after that he will have more time and probably add more hardware to CI, including RISC-V.
* Vincent:
   * can co-mentor the project on improving Python bindings via type annotations.

* Vadim:
   * the slots are allocated, waiting for May 18th for the official announcement.
   * finished work on Ficus tutorial; now making some final touches before alpha can be announced.
   * work on improving RISC-V RVV support and probably adding ARM v9's SVE2 should begin soon.
* Alexander:
   * Alexander A is back from vacation. He started working on UI backends (similar to video I/O backends that he did before)
   * Anna integrated DaSIAM into the tracking API, developed by AA.   
* Shiqi:

      * Deprecate old part of “text” module in contrib
      * OpenCV 3.0..OpenCV 3.2 did not add field “format” that is used to determine xml file version: 2.4x-style and 3.x+ style. Alexander Alekhin added check to code to print warning. Also Alexander Alekhinfixed issues with old code for text detection in contrib.
  * cv::UMat output/input in VideoCapture/VideoWriter (data stays in GPU memory): (#19755)[https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/19755] 
      * Works on Windows and Linux (properly configured environment is required).

### *__Minutes__*
* 1. Feature freeze happened. The official release is targeted at the end of the month.
* 2. OpenCV team will change the branching strategy for the 5.0 release. Rationale: major branches rename breaks a lot of links, including documentation. The goal is to create new major branches and not rename existing ones.
   * a. Master will be renamed to 4.x
   * b. Next will be renamed to 5.x
   * c. No master branch
   * d. Default branch - 5.x
   * e. 6.x will be created for the next major version.
* 3. Proposals for GSoC 2021 are partly approval 
* 4. Jenkins: Xperience AI switched to new networking solution. PRs statuses will be stabilized in a couple of days.
* 5. PRs & Issues:
   * a. Bayer issues: #19629 #18619 #4857
      * i. Deprecate current constants and create new one in 4.x and next
      * ii. AI to Vadim Pisarevsky to work on it.
   * b. Android Camera through NDK ( #19597 )
      * i. Requires minimal supported Android version upgrade.
      * ii. OpenCV team will continue to release OpenCV for Android SDK with conservative strategy with minimal Android version. Native Camera support will not be there. Advanced users can build OpenCV with higher API level and Camera support by their own.
