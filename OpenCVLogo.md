The OpenCV Logo
===============

The **OpenCV** logo is composed of the 3 capital letters **O, C, V** arranged in a triangle. The logo combines several motifs in the spirit of Open Source and Computer Vision.

The 3 letters O, C, V are reminiscent of the famous [Kanizsa triangle optical illusion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanizsa_triangle). The letters are shaped after the **open lock** [OpenSource logo](http://www.opensource.org/). The colors symbolize the common RGB color space.

The logo was designed in 2006 by AdiShavit.
