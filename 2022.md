    * Andrey: Updating docker images for OpenCV python packages building.
    * Alexander P:
      * Feature/aruco speedup PR #3151 (was created to avoid regression in original user PR) and #2790: successfully done rebase ArUco speedup to 4.x
      * looked at Aruco3 article to check PR code
      * fixed several issues (refactoring and merging) from original PR (#2790)
      * created new performance tests
    * Vadim:
      * Finalizing Python types annotation generation (PR #20370) (was blocked by Issue #14730 due to cyclic dependencies between submodules and top level module).
      * Started work on LSTM layer fixes: 
        * constant/dynamic inputs issue (#21118)
        * Abandoned implementation with CuDNN #20938

### *__Minutes__*

* Vadim:
  * Ficus: started working on a tiny deep learning inference engine. The goals are:
    * test ficus in another close-to-real-world scenario
    * prototype the next-gen inference engine for OpenCV
    * experiment with some novel features
  * OpenCV China:
    * PR with Tim-VX support is being debugged to make sure it runs smoothly in our CI.
    * The preliminary performance table for the model zoo was composed (https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo). For Intel platform we currently use the default backend, plan to make use of OpenVINO soon.
* Alexander V:
  * New Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm implementation has been merged: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21018
  * Audio functionality has been integrated into speech recognition sample: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21197
  * Aruco module has been scanned by Protex, no license issues were observed. Aruco code is treated by Protex as OpenCV code managed by OpenCV license. So it can be moved from opencv_contrib to the main opencv repository.
* Alexander S:
  * Done:
    * Alexander S: Prepared CI proposal.
    * Alexander S: Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with #21386, #21351, #609, 
    * Egor:  Added domain support to model diagnostic tool and sent a PR.
    * Egor: Reviewed:
       * #21384: proposed to reuse the existing code and pointed to a way to achieve it.
       * #21415: explained that I'm already working on this and my last working version should outperform the proposed solution.
    * Egor: implemented ONNX Backend API in my branch: opencv side, onnx backend-scoreboard side: Dockerfile(for now I build opencv inside the container, in the future we can install opencv-python from pip); which allows backend-scoreboard to generate the report(index_dev.html). We can probably merge this upstream - backend-scoreboard uses Azure jobs to periodically rerun tests. The resulting support percentage differ from the cpp one because:
        * For cpp I used tests from onnx-master, which aren’t in sync with pip version yet. Python version has a few pytorch-converted tests. OpenCV doesn’t support 1-d mats and resulting shapes differ(e.g. (3,) vs (3,1)).
    * Alexander P: Vacations.
  * In progress:
    * Andrey: Unifying factory method wrapper for classes inherited from cv::Algorithm. #21406
    * Egor: WIP on general broadcasting: offset calculations seem to be correct now.
* Shiqi:
  * The PR by my students has been merged: Add support for 3D point cloud segmentation, using the USAC framework. #21276
* Gary:
  * We've built an autonomous robot that works with Ardupilot but we're having some motor control problems (circles on "straight" command) that hopefully will get resolved. 
  * Futurewei renewed their Gold Membership! The funds are unrestricted but our intent is to use it to further robotics capability in OpenCV 
  * We need to start thinking about Google Summer of Code projects. 
     * Easier, faster load of image of data to something that works with tensors for the major deep learning libraries is one. 
     * Robotics platform stuff is another.

during the meeting it was a lengthy conversation with Alexander S on 1) camera calibration and 2) ONNX coverage in OpenCV DNN

1. Camera Calibration:
  * There is obvious need (multiple user requests and reports, direct or indirect) that camera calibration in OpenCV needs to be revised; indeed, it was build around 20-years old technology, so it's time to upgrade it.
  * Alexander S will start composing evolution proposal to improve camera calibration
  * Much more extensive testing/benchmarking of camera calibration functionality is needed; currently we use very few test cases.
  * Better documentation is needed, in particular, the discussion of the proper use of different calibration rigs
  * Better solver is needed. Probably, the recently added Bundle Adjustment engine can be re-used for camera calibration.
  * The building blocks of camera calibration/stereo camera calibration pipelines that employ RANSAC can be replaced with the corresponding functions from the new USAC framework
  * There are approaches to calibrate camera using an arbitrary textured planar calibration rig (that may include significantly more feature points, compared to the traditional chessboards/circles patterns), e.g. https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/software/descriptors-and-keypoints/bazar/bazar-calib/. We should consider it.
  * Elements from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.x/apps/interactive-calibration could be moved to calib module and/or the app could be better advertised, maybe improved.
  * Aruco module from opencv_contrib could be moved to opencv.
  * There could be helper functions created that would retrieve the name/model of the camera attached to computer (or embedded into smartphone) and the corresponding camera matrix/distortion coefficients can be retrieved from a database.
  * There could be helper functions to conveniently save/restore the calibrated camera information
  * Multi-sensor registration (e.g. TOF camera + RGB camera) could be added as well

2. Deep learning:
  * OpenCV currently covers ~24% of ONNX (according to the following test: http://onnx.ai/backend-scoreboard/onnxruntime_details_stable.html), which is quite low of course (even though we can handle many useful CV models (for classification, detection, tracking, pose estimation, segmentation etc.) and even some speech recognition models). We need to support more.
  * Let's state that by OpenCV 5 we should reach at least 50% in the above-mentioned scoreboard; 70%+ will be a very good result.
  * For that and also for easier integration of various NPU-specific DNN backends we will likely need to revise our graph engine in OpenCV DNN. The inference engine in Ficus (WIP) could probably be used to prototype such advanced graph engine.
  * If by GSoC 2022 we will revise OpenCV DNN design, we could use students to implement some of operations
