### *__Minutes__*

* Vadim:
  * Ficus: started working on a tiny deep learning inference engine. The goals are:
    * test ficus in another close-to-real-world scenario
    * prototype the next-gen inference engine for OpenCV
    * experiment with some novel features
  * OpenCV China:
    * PR with Tim-VX support is being debugged to make sure it runs smoothly in our CI.
    * The preliminary performance table for the model zoo was composed. For Intel platform we currently use the default backend, plan to make use of OpenVINO soon.
* Alexander V:
  * New Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm implementation has been merged: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21018
  * Audio functionality has been integrated into speech recognition sample: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21197
  * Aruco module has been scanned by Protex, no license issues were observed. Aruco code is treated by Protex as OpenCV code managed by OpenCV license
* Alexander S:
  * Done:
    * Alexander S: Prepared CI proposal.
    * Alexander S: Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with #21386, #21351, #609, 
    * Egor:  Added domain support to model diagnostic tool and sent a PR.
    * Egor: Reviewed:
       * #21384: proposed to reuse the existing code and pointed to a way to achieve it.
       * #21415: explained that I'm already working on this and my last working version should outperform the proposed solution.
    * Egor: implemented ONNX Backend API in my branch: opencv side, onnx backend-scoreboard side: Dockerfile(for now I build opencv inside the container, in the future we can install opencv-python from pip); which allows backend-scoreboard to generate the report(index_dev.html). We can probably merge this upstream - backend-scoreboard uses Azure jobs to periodically rerun tests. The resulting support percentage differ from the cpp one because:
        * For cpp I used tests from onnx-master, which aren’t in sync with pip version yet. Python version has a few pytorch-converted tests. OpenCV doesn’t support 1-d mats and resulting shapes differ(e.g. (3,) vs (3,1)).
    * Alexander P: Vacations.
  * In progress:
    * Andrey: Unifying factory method wrapper for classes inherited from cv::Algorithm. #21406
    * Egor: WIP on general broadcasting: offset calculations seem to be correct now.
* Shiqi:
  * The PR by my students has been merged: Add support for 3D point cloud segmentation, using the USAC framework. #21276
* Gary:
  * "Mainly I have to report that I built an autonomous robot but I’m having some motor control problems that hopefully will get resolved. We did get 100 K contribution from futurewei. And we need to start thinking about Google Summer of Code projects. Easier, faster load of image of data to something that works with 10 series of the major deep learning libraries this one. Robotics platform stuff is another."
