## 2022-09-21

* Vadim:
  * [GSoC] All the standard-duration GSoC OpenCV projects are finished and they all seem to be successful.
  * new OpenCV DNN. Currently modifying the kernels to use NC4HW4 layout in the case of 8-bit inference. Zihao found that ONNX developers invented quite interesting technology (called DQD) to avoid explosion of the number of operations required to support various quantized models.
  * [OpenCV China] Huawei Ascend backend of OpenCV DNN is in progress. A few more bugs have been fixed. Currently there are some issues with speed and accuracy, Yuantao is working on it.
  * [OpenCV China] Zihao Mu is working on finalizing StackBlur patch: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/20379
  * parallel jpeg decoder/encoder?
* Shiqi:
  * Promoting OpenCV competition: registration for the OAK-based submissions track is over, the other track is end of October: https://opencv.org/opencv-ai-competition-2022
  * Pushing area chair: scheduled meeting with area chairs in the beginning of October.
* Suleyman:
  * Suggested to introduce a separate function to read image header that will retrieve image size and maybe color information etc. Such function can be useful for save image I/O.
* Vincent:
  * OpenCV is officially cited in some copyright notices.
  * Will get back to HLS2RGB.
  * Q: whether OpenCV supports AV1 codec. Alexander S: yes, as long as there is fresh FFMPEG with AV1 codec enabled.
  * Parallel decoding is a good idea, several codecs support it.
  * Possibly it could be useful to have API to decode just part of the image.
  * Sometimes passing environment variables into sandboxed environment can be difficult. Would be nice to have some official API to control image I/O, not via environment variables.
  * Info to retrieve by the image header codec: image size, depth, number of channels, quality (lossy/lossless).
* Gary:
  * TBD
* Alexander S (x.ai):
  * Done:
    * The number of open PRs in the main repository is reduced from ~150 to ~120. The nearest goal is to reduce it further to less than 100.
    * Andrey:
      * Was debugging videoio accuracy test failures on Windows runner and changed an execution of these tests iteratively instead of parallelism. [#13](https://github.com/opencv-infrastructure/opencv-gha-dockerfile/pull/13), [#60](https://github.com/opencv/ci-gha-workflow/pull/60)
      * [Alexander Smorkalov](mailto:alexander.smorkalov@xperience.ai): Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with ## 21942, 20379,  3325, 22363, 22285, 22128, 21966, contrib #3351

      * Implemented early QR code version decoding for classic QR code detector. Statistics on benchmark data: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yiRfVtQwSvQBvpU7tjqzUVl-pm7Tmee1ADPARg3XSFo/edit#gid=485190276).
      * Experiments on lightweight alignment markers detection and accurate alignment for large QRs is in progress.
  * In progress:
    * Andrey:
      * Modifying pipelines in opencv-python repo to triggering them from another repository.
    * Alexander Smorkalov: RISC-V board setup for testing and CI

## 2022-09-14

* Vadim:
  * Implemented Winograd-based 3x3 convolution
  * [GSoC] it's now the final week of the GSoC 2022 (except for the extended projects (we have 1 such project)). Mentors need to submit final evaluations.

## 2022-07-27

It's GSoC 2022 phase-1 time now!
Here is some intermediate status from our respective mentors:

* Yuantao F:
  1. Lightweight object detection model for OpenCV model zoo. The student has provided sample code and quantized model (variation of nanodet): https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/pull/75. Mixed performance, but overall it's a pass. For phase 2 yet another 1-2 models should be added, including variations of yolo and another nanodet.
  2. Multi-task CV model: pull request with code and model in PyTorch format is also there: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/pull/74. ONNX model is not provided yet. And the model is not quantized yet. At least, it will be converted to FP16 if INT8 does not work properly.
* Zihao M:
  1. Text detection project. PR with DB model is submitted: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/pull/73. The model works very well, 2Mb (English version) or <10Mb (English+Chinese), it's 2-3x faster than the previous model that was submitted to OpenCV at GSoC 2020.
  2. Text recognition. PR is also submitted: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/pull/71. Now the quality of the model is being estimated. The model is not quantized yet. Zihao is adding missing operations to OpenCV to support the model.
* Jean-Yves Bouguet:
  1. Maksym is working on multi-camera calibration, including pinhole and fisheye cameras. Some tools in Python have been implemented to visualize calibration process. Now some code is implemented to evaluate how robust is the configuration of cameras, how stable was the calibration process. In other words, we want to detect corner cases, e.g. when the board views occupy very small field of view. Also, the code is going to be tested on real data, not just artificial datasets used so far. Overall, several normal and challenging test cases are going to added. Quite satisfied with the performance.
* Jia W:
  1. Speech recognition model. 2 models are considered. The first model works not well but supported by OpenCV. Another model gives better quality, but is not supported by OpenCV yet (and is also very slow). Pass, but with reservations.
  2. Data augmentation project. The project goes well. 10x-50x faster than TorchVision data augmentation framework. For now only traditional vision transformations are supported. It's a definite pass.
* Prof. Xing:
  1. RISC-V acceleration. The student Liutong works very well, submitted the first PR (and it was merged). It's a pass, of course.

* Vadim:
  * All OpenCV GSoC projects we voted for have been accepted! Congratulations to all the accepted students!
  * Vadim together with OpenCV China folks continue to optimize OpenCV DNN Engine (convolution kernel mostly) and the standalone DL inference engine in Ficus; Resnet-50, batch_size=1, FP32 precision, is now processed in 26.6ms on Apple M1 (4 threads)! It's quite a breakthrough compared to 37-42ms in the previous version of the patch (and much better than 60+ ms in the existing OpenCV). Now the patch needs to be updated with the latest changes that brought the extra performance.

  * GSoC 2022: there are 14 ideas already in https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2022. Potential mentors and contributors are welcome to join to https://groups.google.com/g/opencv-gsoc-2022.
  * Just started implementation of light-weight "Loops" JIT engine to accelerate OpenCV and Ficus: https://github.com/vpisarev/loops
* Vincent:
  * almost got rid of C API in the internal projects.
  * right shift of negative numbers (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21588) - will likely reject, because OpenCV heavily relies on 2-complement representation of negative numbers and how right shifts are implemented.
  * custom InputArrays in OpenCV 5 (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/20869).
  * resolving int64 definition ambiguity in OpenCV 5 (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/7573)
  * Interesting project from NVidia: https://nvlabs.github.io/instant-ngp/
* Shiqi:
  * Trying to find more resources to support OpenCV China.
  * Contacted one big chip company to possibly support OpenCV.
  * Probably should resume communication with T-head on OpenCV+RISC-V.
* Gary:
  * Could add some more ideas. It would be nice to have some robotics projects (multi-camera calibration, apriltags, SLAM etc.)

* Vadim:
  * Ficus: started working on a tiny deep learning inference engine. The goals are:
    * test ficus in another close-to-real-world scenario
    * prototype the next-gen inference engine for OpenCV
    * experiment with some novel features
  * OpenCV China:
    * PR with Tim-VX support is being debugged to make sure it runs smoothly in our CI.
    * The preliminary performance table for the model zoo was composed (https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo). For Intel platform we currently use the default backend, plan to make use of OpenVINO soon.
* Alexander V:
  * New Levenberg-Marquadt algorithm implementation has been merged: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21018
  * Audio functionality has been integrated into speech recognition sample: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21197
  * Aruco module has been scanned by Protex, no license issues were observed. Aruco code is treated by Protex as OpenCV code managed by OpenCV license. So it can be moved from opencv_contrib to the main opencv repository.
* Alexander S:
  * Done:
    * Alexander S: Prepared CI proposal.
    * Alexander S: Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with #21386, #21351, #609, 
    * Egor:  Added domain support to model diagnostic tool and sent a PR.
    * Egor: Reviewed:
       * #21384: proposed to reuse the existing code and pointed to a way to achieve it.
       * #21415: explained that I'm already working on this and my last working version should outperform the proposed solution.
    * Egor: implemented ONNX Backend API in my branch: opencv side, onnx backend-scoreboard side: Dockerfile(for now I build opencv inside the container, in the future we can install opencv-python from pip); which allows backend-scoreboard to generate the report(index_dev.html). We can probably merge this upstream - backend-scoreboard uses Azure jobs to periodically rerun tests. The resulting support percentage differ from the cpp one because:
        * For cpp I used tests from onnx-master, which aren’t in sync with pip version yet. Python version has a few pytorch-converted tests. OpenCV doesn’t support 1-d mats and resulting shapes differ(e.g. (3,) vs (3,1)).
    * Alexander P: Vacations.
  * In progress:
    * Andrey: Unifying factory method wrapper for classes inherited from cv::Algorithm. #21406
    * Egor: WIP on general broadcasting: offset calculations seem to be correct now.
* Shiqi:
  * The PR by my students has been merged: Add support for 3D point cloud segmentation, using the USAC framework. #21276
* Gary:
  * We've built an autonomous robot that works with Ardupilot but we're having some motor control problems (circles on "straight" command) that hopefully will get resolved. 
  * Futurewei renewed their Gold Membership! The funds are unrestricted but our intent is to use it to further robotics capability in OpenCV 
  * We need to start thinking about Google Summer of Code projects. 
     * Easier, faster load of image of data to something that works with tensors for the major deep learning libraries is one. 
     * Robotics platform stuff is another.
==
during the meeting it was a lengthy conversation with Alexander S on 1) camera calibration and 2) ONNX coverage in OpenCV DNN

1. Camera Calibration:
  * There is obvious need (multiple user requests and reports, direct or indirect) that camera calibration in OpenCV needs to be revised; indeed, it was build around 20-years old technology, so it's time to upgrade it.
  * Alexander S will start composing evolution proposal to improve camera calibration
  * Much more extensive testing/benchmarking of camera calibration functionality is needed; currently we use very few test cases.
  * Better documentation is needed, in particular, the discussion of the proper use of different calibration rigs
  * Better solver is needed. Probably, the recently added Bundle Adjustment engine can be re-used for camera calibration.
  * The building blocks of camera calibration/stereo camera calibration pipelines that employ RANSAC can be replaced with the corresponding functions from the new USAC framework
  * There are approaches to calibrate camera using an arbitrary textured planar calibration rig (that may include significantly more feature points, compared to the traditional chessboards/circles patterns), e.g. https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/software/descriptors-and-keypoints/bazar/bazar-calib/. We should consider it.
  * Elements from https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/4.x/apps/interactive-calibration could be moved to calib module and/or the app could be better advertised, maybe improved.
  * Aruco module from opencv_contrib could be moved to opencv.
  * There could be helper functions created that would retrieve the name/model of the camera attached to computer (or embedded into smartphone) and the corresponding camera matrix/distortion coefficients can be retrieved from a database.
  * There could be helper functions to conveniently save/restore the calibrated camera information
  * Multi-sensor registration (e.g. TOF camera + RGB camera) could be added as well

2. Deep learning:
  * OpenCV currently covers ~24% of ONNX (according to the following test: http://onnx.ai/backend-scoreboard/onnxruntime_details_stable.html), which is quite low of course (even though we can handle many useful CV models (for classification, detection, tracking, pose estimation, segmentation etc.) and even some speech recognition models). We need to support more.
  * Let's state that by OpenCV 5 we should reach at least 50% in the above-mentioned scoreboard; 70%+ will be a very good result.
  * For that and also for easier integration of various NPU-specific DNN backends we will likely need to revise our graph engine in OpenCV DNN. The inference engine in Ficus (WIP) could probably be used to prototype such advanced graph engine.
  * If by GSoC 2022 we will revise OpenCV DNN design, we could use students to implement some of operations
