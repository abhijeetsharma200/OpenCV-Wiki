OpenCV Project Ideas List:
=========================
### **>> IDEAS LIST UNDER CONSTRUCTION _1/15/2019_ <<**

Make your idea compliant with [_Defining a Project Ideas list from the Mentor Guide_](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list)

Students may propose their own projects
- Give us a clear summary of what you want to do and 
- Proof that you have the experience to do this project 

Below are our priorities (not in order)

Discuss ideas on the [group mailing list site](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/opencv-gsoc-2019)

--

1. ### Tutorials

   We have so much good code in [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) as well as [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) that needs better documentation, tutorials, examples of use etc. See
   - [OpenCV C++ Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/df8/tutorial_root.html)
   - [OpenCV Python Tutorials](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html)

   - **Difficulty:** Easy to Medium depending on algorithms selected to create tutorials on
      - **Time:** Each topic takes about 2 weeks. One week to code examples, uses, record videos and another week to write it up. You can, therefore, do about 6 topics over the summer.
      - This topic is open to multiple students who will work independently on different tutorials

1. ### Deep Learning

   - NVidia support for DNN
      - Several example implementation
      - Darknet
      - Ask NVidia for references
         - Davis King Dlib?
   - Emed a composable model that is trainable but works then with DNN?
   - Curate more models 
      - optical flow? April Tags? Replace traditional methods such as color conversion? 

1. ### Differential operators
   - point coordinate regression DSNT https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.07372
      - https://github.com/anibali/dsntnn
   - differentiable randsac gsac https://github.com/vislearn/DSACLine
   - decomposeHomography

1. ### Calibration
   - Circular calibration objects -- getting the geometric center
      - Improve circular fiducial calibration object detection
         - [Geometric Correction of Circular Fiducials](https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00990239)
   
1. ### Geometric
   - Homography
      - decomposeHomography more help functions for R and T
   - SolvePnPRansac doesn't work, or doesn't work well

1. ### Data Augmentation
   - Things that help with data augmentation for training networks
   - Lighting functions
   - spherical or cylindrical views around a planar object
   - noise ...
   - for 3D point clouds

1. ### Data I/O
   - Fixing EXR import/export
   - Expand image types ... but especially exr
   - Standard data storage, say yaml ... can we get a binary format?

1. ### Methods of changing/perturbing lighting
    - Gamma
    - Look at cinematographic techniques

1. ### Fiducials
    - Logo and Picture => Fiducial tag
    - Networks that detects fiducials (tain)
       - "harness" to train
    - Add April Tags to OpenCV, with DNN detection
       - [April Tags are described here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/)
          - Train MNet to segment tags to high performance
          - Move network into DNN
          - Feed the detections to the April Tag algorithm
       - **Difficulty** Hard. Must be able to train deep nets and use ONNX or other to port to DNN currated nets and then add a method for feeding in detected tags to the April tag algorithm (ported to OpenCV).

1. ### SLAM, oi vey

   - **Difficulty** Extreme. Few people have the skills to get SLAM working well

1. ### HighGUI

   [HighGUI]https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html) is OpenCV's simple graphical user interface including event triggering. It's cool, but it's old. It needs expanding. 
   - We, the admins, actually place a high priority of getting the simple basic stuff to work well, so we very much encourage application to this project
   - HighGUI stands relatively alone and so can be easily changed without a deep knowledge of computer vision.
   - Some of its needs are:
      - Add simple buttons and sliders
      - It has an optional QT interface, but it involves some messy loading and linking into a very large external code base for what is relatively simple additional functionality.
         - Add the QT functionality (mainly zoom to pixel and snap shot) w/o the QT dependency; 
         - one option is to use OpenGL and draw various controls manually.
   - **Difficulty:** Medium. This is a lot of UI coding that can be done in very small, modular chunks (adding buttons for example).
   - "vector graphics" -- in a separate layer
   - Drag and drop a point (control point) that can be moved

1. ### Better image & video encoding/decoding (talk to vincent)

   - Bringing significant improvements into gstreamer backend of videoio
   - Hardware-accelerated video codecs via libyami (https://github.com/01org/libyami)
   - Replacing jasper with openjpeg to encode and decode Jpeg 2000 images
   - Any other good suggestions/projects to reduce OpenCV dependency of ffmpeg
   - **Difficulty:** Hard. This involves knowledge of video codecs etc

1. Facial landmarks (or anything people)
   - 3 different models last year, but model files not shared, get them
   - 68 pt model can be large. Smaller model w/same # of points for mobile
   - up to dlib accuracy, with differing numbers of points
   - stabilization (filtering/optical flow)

How you will be evaluated if you are an accepted student
--------------------------------------------------------

- Student projects to be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of student code
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has basic functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has basic unit test
            - Has a tutorial of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
    - **End of summer:**
        - A full pull request
            - Full Doxygen documentation
            - A good unit test
            - Example of use/tutorial of the code or net
        - Create a (short!) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your code
            - We use this to create an overall summary. Past years:
                - [The 2015 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s)
                - [The 2014 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA)
                - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)

For students interested in applying
-----------------------------------

1.  You **must** already know how to program fluently in C++
    - Some projects may instead specifically require Python, javascript or Matlab skills
2.  Ask to join the opencv-gsoc mailing list above
    - Discuss projects ideas below or your own ideas with OpenCV mentors on the list.
    - Always title your proposal with what you want to do (example: *Implement Patch Match Stereo Algorithm* )
        - **NOTE:** The above is to discuss proposals with mentors. **BUT**, when the application period starts, you must still sign up with Google Summmer of Code and submit your proposal to the OpenCV organization. If not, you will not show up on the database where we can select you as a student.
3.  Sign up to be a student with OpenCV
4.  Post the project from below or your own agreed on project on the GSoC to opencv-gsoc mailing list above
    - Include Name, google email
    - Include how you think you are qualified to accomplish this project (skills, courses, relevant background)
    - Include Country of origin, school you are enrolled in, Professor you work with (if any)
    - Include a projected timeline and milestones for the project
5.  When (and if!) OpenCV gets accepted as GSoC org this year, and we are told how many slots we will get **and** you've signed up for a project with us, **Then:**
    - We will weigh the students and projects against the mentors we gather and the mentor's interests and choose which students/project to pursue.
    - Accepted students will be posted on the GSoC site (and we will notify the accepted students ourselves afterwards).
    - Students are paid over the summer by Google **IF** the mentor accepts the student's work. There are several milestone based go-nogo points as above.
6.  We've had a lot of experience with this: Please only propose projects that you already know how to do. 
    - It is impossible for a mentor to train you in how to do the task while helping you do it. This **always** results in failure.
    - Mentors exist to keep you on track, and ensure good code, but not to teach you a new area of vision or AI.
    - This is also not a _research_ period. If you are a top student with publications in top conferences from a top professor in a top University known to us, we may let you code your research area. This is rare.
    - Documentation, tests and tutorial are as vital as the code. We'd rather have rougher code then miss these items because if these are not in place, your code will be useless to everyone.

For computer vision professionals interested in mentoring
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  Contact us on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
4.  You then:
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through student project proposals, find a student and project you like and work with them to refine a realistic proposal that they can implement in a summer (you have to judge whether the student is capable - **you must verify that they can already code in the language (mostly C++) specified.** Summer is too short to learn to code and get something done).
        - you may also find (good) students and get them to apply, perhaps on your pet project idea
    - Once you find or create a project proposal that you want to mentor
        - several students might try for the same project
        - alternatively, you might have to convince a student to change projects to one you like or recruit an external student to join Google Summer of Code and apply to your project
    - But, always encourage students to officially apply through the Google Summer of Code site
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6.  Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
    - Sheesh!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable student **and** we give you a slot **and** the student signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations. 
   - Thank you for trying. 
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

It sounds harder than it is.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
