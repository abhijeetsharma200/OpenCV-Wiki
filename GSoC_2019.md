### **How to Apply**

OpenCV is taking part in [GSoC 2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/5654472617885696/). Below is a list of ideas from the OpenCV [developers](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog#contributors), [staff](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019/_edit#staff) and [Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals). _**Note:** We have a pre-application [form](https://goo.gl/forms/eF8G5TYIYzTjSxAJ2) below prior to Mar 25, but you must also register with [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) and apply to OpenCV there between March 25-April 9. See our [timeline below](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019#important-dates)_


1. **Requirements:**
   - You **must** already know how to program fluently in C++!
   - Some projects may instead specifically require Python, javascript or Matlab skills
   - Some projects may require knowledge of Deep Nets and perhaps one or more of the standard packages:
      - PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet. Familiarity with OpenCV's DNN ([here for code](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/dnn) and [here for samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn)) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) deep net exchange is a big plus
1. **Please familiarize yourself with the:** 
   1. [OpenCV Developer's site](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki), the 
   1. [User's site](https://opencv.org/), read through our
   1. [Ideas List](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019#opencv-project-ideas-list) to see which projects are of interest to you, and familiarize yourself with
   1. The [GSoC 2019 timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline)
1. **Sign up:** for the [OpenCV_GSoC_2019 mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/opencv-gsoc-2019) where you can ask questions, exchange and discuss ideas with students and mentors, get announcements etc.
1. **Fill out:** the [pre-application form](https://goo.gl/forms/eF8G5TYIYzTjSxAJ2) for the one or two (_maximum_) projects you are interested in.
1. **Optional steps mentors may take:**
   * Mentors may contact you for hangouts or other means of live interview
   * You may be asked for proof of coding
   * You will probably be asked for a full project plan
1. **How to enhance your application:**
   1. Contributing to OpenCV is a **big plus**. Some suggestions:
      1. Fixing an [bug/issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues) or
      1. Very advanced people can already start delivering code for the idea they like to their mentor
      1. More realistically and still **great**: REALLY learn some OpenCV function and contribute a well written tutorial on it

# Ideas:

1. ### Area: Calibration
   1. #### _IDEA:_ Calibration Patterns using Circular Features
      * ***Description:*** OpenCV currently allows checkerboard, Aruco, mixed and a basic circular calibration grid. Circular patterns have very good detectability across scale, but the Circular calibration feature in OpenCV is not complete because when a circle is viewed in perspective, the center of the circle is not at the center of mass. This introduces a systematic error into calibration with circular patterns. This can be corrected by compensating for perspective distortion.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         * Review the papers on the topic in resources below.
         * Code up a circular calibration module that implements the adjusts the circle center for perspective distortion.
         * Extensive validation (using other patterns and the circular pattern) that shows the circular pattern returning expected intrinsic and distortion camera parameters.
         * Optimizing the module to run efficiently
         * Python interface to the module
         * Resources
            * [Geometric Correction of Circular Fiducials](https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00990239); direct [pdf link](https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00990239/document)
            * [Valication Code for Circular Correction](https://github.com/vicrucann/Kmat-virtual)
      * ***Skills Required:*** Solid C++, Coursework and/or experience in camera calibration. Python is a plus because we want calibration to be callable from Python. Mainly, calibration software depends on the details, so being detail oriented is critical as well as the willingness to write thorough test code. 
      * ***Mentors:*** Grace Vesom, Gholamreza Amayeh 
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium
   
1. ### Area: Data Augmentation
   1. #### _IDEA:_ Computer vision data augmentation module
      * ***Description:*** Deep learning networks are hungry for data and data augmentation is one of the easiest ways to increase data variation. Augmentation could be as simple image flipping, cropping and scaling on up to more complicated transformations such style transfer using another deep learning network. For computer vision problems, OpenCV is often used for reading images in most of training scenarios, so why we'd like to enhance data reading with simple to use data augmentation techniques as well.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:***
         1. Analyze which image transformations are widely used for image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation problems.
            - Things that help with data augmentation for training networks
               - Lighting functions
               - spherical or cylindrical views around a planar object
               - noise ...
               - for 3D point clouds
         1. Create a new OpenCV's module (or use an existing one such `datasets` or `dnn`?) with at least the following functionality:
             - Provide an API to apply single transformations to an Image or batch of Images, Rectangles (i.e. for ground truth for object detection), Masks.
             - Let users combine different transformations in the class object which can apply them with some probability.
             - Custom data transformations which can be included in the augmentation classes.
         1. Write tutorials targeting on Python wrappers due it's the most popular language supported by different DL frameworks right now.
             - These should in particular show use with PyTorch and TensorFlow.
      * ***Skills Required:*** Experience in image processing and deep learning networks training for computer vision problems.
      * ***Mentors:*** Dmitry Kurtaev
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

   2. #### _IDEA:_ 3D Augmentation & April Tags
      * ***Description:*** 3D computer vision related data is represented mainly in two formats: volumetric data and point clouds. It is usually jointly combined with 2D data processing approaches and 3D approaches for semantic inference and fusion. In this project, we focus on contributing 3D semantic processing modules without dependence of heavy deep architectures. One application would be the April Tags recognition task.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:***
         1. Modify [TSDF-Fusion](https://github.com/andyzeng/tsdf-fusion) (_**T**runcated **S**igned **D**istance **F**unction-Fusion_) to produce 3D scenes (point clouds) from a sequence of depth images.
         1. On top of TSDF Fusion, implement [PCN](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wyuan1/pcn/)-like architecture for 3D completion from depth images. Try to make it more efficient by getting rid of convolutional operations for 3D data.
         1. C++/CUDA based 3D visualization APIs which are capable for rendering points clouds in the form of .ply or .obj files into high-quality mesh models with realistic shadows.
                        * (Additional) Implement AprilTag for full 6 DOF localization of features from a single image. Try to solve problems introduced by occlusion and bad lighting conditions.
         * resources:
            * [TSDF-Fusion](https://github.com/andyzeng/tsdf-fusion)
            * [PCN](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~wyuan1/pcn/)
            * [AprilTag](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/)
            * [PointNet](https://github.com/charlesq34/pointnet)
            * [FoldingNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.07262)
      * ***Skills Required:*** Experience in 3D data processing and linear algebra. Good at C++ and familiar with CUDA. Students should be able to understand the basic idea behind 3D point clouds deep learning approaches from basic PointNet.
      * ***Mentors:*** Yida Wang
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium-Hard


1. ### Area: Deep Learning
   1. #### _IDEA:_ Allow the OpenCV Deep Neural Net Module (DNN) to work with GPUs
      * ***Description:*** The [OpenCV Deep Neural Network (DNN) Module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/dnn) takes [deepnets found on the net]((https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Deep-Learning-in-OpenCV)) and runs them [5x faster than Pytorch or Tensorflow](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/DNN-Efficiency) on CPUs. Programmers find DNN [simple to use with powerful results](https://www.learnopencv.com/hand-keypoint-detection-using-deep-learning-and-opencv/). But, DNN is missing an NVidia GPU backend. This project aims at adding that missing GPU backend. 
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         * Developed plan to port the existing CPU backend to support GPU
            * Review tools [NVidia here](https://developer.nvidia.com/how-to-cuda-c-cpp), [Kokkos here](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos), [RAJA here](https://github.com/LLNL/RAJA), [OpenCL here](https://www.khronos.org/opencl/), and [CUDA here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-zone).
         * Implemented the new GPU backend for DNN
         * A test suite that compares CPU results with GPU results and makes sure they are close 
         * Performance as fast or faster than native use of nets on GPUs with TensorFlow and Pytorch
         * Resources
            * In general, you can leverage the [CUDA backend for Torch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/cuda.html) or DLib (Mentor has info) 
            * [DNN Module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/dnn)

   1. #### _IDEA:_ Improve the performance of JavaScript version of OpenCV (OpenCV.js)
      * ***Description:*** OpenCV.js makes OpenCV functions available to JavaScript developers by compiling its C++ implementation to WebAssembly (or Asm.js) and exposing them through a JavaScript binding. However the current version of OpenCV.js only runs in single thread and doesn't use SIMD instructions. This causes the performance of OpenCV.js is far below the native version and prevents some real-time use cases to be deployed in web browser. This task aims to improve the performance of OpenCV.js by exploiting parallelism of CPU. This requires to port the parallel implementations of OpenCV source code to web by leveraging Threads and SIMD features of WebAssembly.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:***

1. ### Area: SLAM / Camera Pose / RGBD / 3D reconstruction
   1. #### _IDEA:_ KinectFusion improvements
      * ***Description:***
         We have a KinectFusion 3d reconstruction algorithm which works reasonably well. However its practical use is limited by the list of reasons:
         - its space is limited and cannot extend as the camera moves
         - (connected to previous one) its space representation consumes too much memory
         - it cannot process non-rigid scenes like with living people or animals (even slight moves leaves running average artifacts)

         That's why there are 2 main ways of improvement:

         - Large scale implementations of the algorithm like Kintinuous or KinFu Large Scale
         - Implementing DynamicFusion which handles non-rigid scenes (seems more preferable because of already existing code from GSoC 2017)
         It's up to participant what way to choose.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         GSoC participant is expected to build a version of the chosen algorithm that conforms to OpenCV standards:
         - it has (maybe slow) CPU version
         - it has tests w/ captured depth or rendered scene as it's done in OpenCV's KinFu version
         - it builds, it works and produces fine results at least on one dataset (better if this works in live mode)
         - it has as few dependencies as it is possible (ideal case is no dependencies outside of OpenCV)

         This should be done inside `rgbd` module as a separate class based on existing KinFu class.
         The set of methods may be extended by the ones to export resulting 3d model in any form (at least points+normals).

         * Resources
           - [DynamicFusion](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dynamicfusion/papers/DynamicFusion.pdf) which is able to handle non-rigidness by introducing local transformations
           - [Kintinuous](http://www.cs.nuim.ie/research/vision/data/rgbd2012/) large-scale version of KinFu which is based on pose-graph
           - [KinFu Large Scale](http://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/using_kinfu_large_scale.php) this one is based on marching cubes

      * ***Skills Required:*** good understanding of 3d math, experienced in C++, experience in computer vision or image processing (at least one successful project), a lot of patience
      * ***Mentors:*** Rostislav Vasilikhin
      * ***Difficulty:*** from Hard to Extreme (based on the fact that there was one unsuccessful attempt in the past GSoC)
   1. #### _IDEA:_ _This is a placeholder:_ We may add an idea for Mobile SLAM 2/13/2019
      * ideas from http://imagine.enpc.fr/~moulonp/openMVG/coreFeatures.html

1. ### Area: Tracking, Human Tracking, and Segmentation
   1. #### _IDEA:_ Facial Landmark Detector
      * ***Description:*** Facial feature detection and tracking is a high value area of computer vision since humans are interested in what humans are paying attention to, feeling, and enhancing face pictures in selfies etc. At this point, we feel this should just become a standard "built in" ability that computer vision users can just call/rely on. OpenCV already has some code available on for Facial Landmark detection, see [Tutorial on Facial Landmark Detector API](https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/d5/d47/tutorial_table_of_content_facemark.html) and  [Tutorials for face module](https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/de/d27/tutorial_table_of_content_face.html), but much progress has been made that we want to make available. The task is to create a Facial Landmark detector model with the following requirements:
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         * For mobile, make available a smaller model with lesser points ( e.g. 5 instead of 68 )
         * Run at better Accuracy than Dlib
         * Face Stabilization ( filtering and optical flow )
         * Add it to the Python API
         * Resources
            * https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/d5/d47/tutorial_table_of_content_facemark.html
            * https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/de/d27/tutorial_table_of_content_face.html
            * https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/face
      * ***Skills Required:*** mastery level C++ and Python, college course work in Computer Vision that includes work on face features. Best if you have worked with deep networks before.
      * ***Mentors:*** Satya Mallick
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

   1. #### _IDEA:_ A universal boosted cascades interface
      * ***Description:*** Boosted cascades, before the era of deep learning, have long been the state-of-the-art for object detection and decision learning. When moving to OpenCV4 future releases, the plan is to remove them because of the old C-API backend and the tons of issues with the current implementation. This project will focus on re-implementing the boosted cascades, through an open and universal interface, that will allow applying these techniques, combined with newer feature generation algorithms like for example CNNS.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         * Re-implement the boosted cascades / softcascades basic algorithm into OpenCV4.0 
         * Provide universal feature adding functionality: more than the previous HAAR/LBP/HOG 
         * Provide training, detection and evaluation interfaces
         * Resources
            * https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/d88/tutorial_traincascade.html
            * https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/apps
      * ***Skills Required:*** efficient in C++ coding, college course work in classic computer vision, mediate experience in deep learning can help to include them as feature generators
      * ***Mentors:*** Steven Puttemans
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. ### Area: Tutorials

   1. #### _IDEA:_ General Tutorials with Video
      * ***Description:*** Videos have proven to be one of the most effective and engaging tools for learning.
In this GSoC project, we will be adding videos to the existing OpenCV tutorials.
The goal of these videos is to introduce the Computer Vision theoretical concepts behind each tutorial.
We will provide our users with a better understanding of the theory and hopefully they will achieve better results when implementing their own projects.
         * Additionally, we aim for our documentation to be versatile, hence, a second goal of this project is to keep working towards multi-language tutorials (C++, Python, Java, ...)
and work on the associated tools.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         1. Add 1 youtube video to each tutorial (set of tutorials to be defined)
         1. Add Java and Python version to the currently C++ only tutorials
         1. Add quick navigation (previous/next tutorial) to all the tutorials
         1. Contribute to the merge of the python documentation with the general one
      * ***Skills Required:*** C++, Python, Java, Computer Vision, English.
      * ***Mentors:*** Joao Cartucho, Steven Puttemans _(if more than one student)_
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

   1. #### _IDEA:_ Improve Machine Learning Tutorials and Documentation
      * ***Description:*** The **D**eep **N**eural **N**etwork (**DNN**) module is new and light on good tutorials. The **M**achine **L**earning (**ML**) Module is old and needs a tutorial refresh. The task is to create tutorials (code example applications and describe) for the machine learning/deep neural network modules and to update / improve / expand existing tutorials ( Mostly in C++ ) for the main OpenCV module as well as some opencv_contrib modules. This includes improving the documentation of newly added modules if required.

      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         1. Write tutorials for DNN Module. 
            1. Code examples and create a tutorial on how the DNN module is structured and create a video explaining the important functions in the DNN module.
            1. Add code samples and write-ups on the usage of ONNX models.
            1. Search for real-time state-of-the-art models and port it to OpenCV.
         1. Improve and expand write-ups / videos for sample code already present in the repository but no tutorials. E.g.:
            1. [DNN](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/cpp)
               1. Image Classification using Tensorflow
               1. Object Detection using Tensorflow API
               1. Semantic Segmentation
               1. Image Colorization
               1. Neural Style Transfer
               1. OpenPose
            1. C++ code samples present in [opencv repo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/cpp). e.g.
                  1. DIS Optical Flow
         1. Add code samples and write-ups for using different algorithms e.g.
            1. ML module
               1. Normal Bayes Classifier
               1. Decision Trees
               1. Random Forests
               1. ANN MLP
               1. K-NN
               1. K-Means
            1. Text Module in OpenCV Contrib
         1. Tutorial Series on using OpenVINO models and DLDT toolkit.
      * ***Skills Required:*** Excellent written English, Mastery level C++ knowledge, college course work in Computer Vision, Python knowledge. Working knowledge of deep neural networks.
      * ***Mentors:*** Vikas Gupta
      * ***Difficulty:*** Easy 

1. ### Area: User Interface
   1. #### _IDEA:_ Improve the OpenCV user interface
      * ***Description:*** [HighGUI](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html) is OpenCV's graphical user interface including event triggering. It's cool, but it's old and needs revamping. HighGUI has been improved by using a QT interface at the cost of a large library to link in. We want to replace the QT functionality (mainly zoom to pixel and snapshot) with custom code. We'd also like to add native buttons.
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         * Drop QT dependency but retain at least zoom to pixel and snapshot capability with custom code
         * Add buttons as a native capability
         * Allow setting up an adaptive array of display windows w/in one larger window.
         * Retain ability for Python to call HighGUI
         * Resources
            * [High GUI documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html)
            * [High GUI tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4.0/d0/de2/tutorial_table_of_content_highgui.html)
      * ***Skills Required:*** C++, Python, user interface experience
      * ***Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky
      * ***Difficulty:*** Easy if you are well familiar with GUI, Medium if not.

For computer vision professionals interested in mentoring
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  Contact us by March 25th on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * [The Mentor Only Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv_mentors_2019)
       * [The Student+Mentor Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2019)
       * [The Proposals Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CgIu7yNYMyuX5eEtjHIg_2AGgaTlIaaAOr14ulADKM0)
4.  You then:
    - Look through the [ideas above](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019#opencv-project-ideas-list), choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through student project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen. 
       - Find likely students, ask [them to apply](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019#how-to-apply) to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of students who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a student or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your students officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) before April 9th.
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6.  Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable student **and** we give you a slot **and** the student signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations. 
   - Thank you for trying. 
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
