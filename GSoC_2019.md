      * ***Description:*** Create a dedicated `optflow` module in the main repository consolidating the best available (within the library) collection of sparse and dense optical flow algorithms. We have LK optical flow, various sparse algorithms and the classical Farneback algorithm along with the better DIS optical flow. There may be some deep optical flow that's available in [OpenCV dnn samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn).
      * ***Expected Outcomes:***

         * Select the best optical flow modules (move those out of the former optflow in opencv_contrib)
         * Make a base class with standard method from which all optical flow estimators will derive. Some attempts to do that can already be found in [the video module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/video)
         * Even though we consolidate API and move to the uniform object-oriented API, we need to keep the old API for backward compatibility (e.g. `cv::computeOptFlowFarneback` etc.).
         * Resources

1. ### Area: Calibration
   - Circular calibration objects -- getting the geometric center
      - Improve circular fiducial calibration object detection
         - [Geometric Correction of Circular Fiducials](https://hal-enpc.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00990239)
   
1. ### Area: Data Augmentation
   1. #### _IDEA:_ Computer vision data augmentation module
      * ***Description:*** Deep learning networks are hungry to data and the augmentation is one of the easiest way to increase data variation. It could be as simple image flipping, cropping and scaling as more complicated transformations such style transfer using another deep learning networks. For computer vision problems we can definitely say that OpenCV is used for reading images in the most of the training scenarios. So why not to use it as an augmentation library too?
      * ***Expected Outcomes:***
         1. Analyze which image transformations are widely used for image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation problems.
            - Things that help with data augmentation for training networks
               - Lighting functions
               - spherical or cylindrical views around a planar object
               - noise ...
               - for 3D point clouds
         1. Create a new OpenCV's module (or use an existing one such `datasets` or `dnn`?) with at least the following functionality:
             - Provide an API to apply single transformations to an Image or batch of Images, Rectangles (i.e. for ground truth for object detection), Masks.
             - Let users combine different transformations in the class object which can apply them with some probability.
             - Custom data transformations which can be included in the augmentation classes.
         1. Write tutorials targeting on Python wrappers due it's the most popular language supported by different DL frameworks right now.
      * ***Skills Required:*** Experience in image processing and deep learning networks training for computer vision problems.
      * ***Mentors:*** Dmitry Kurtaev
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium


1. ### Area: Data I/O
   - Fixing EXR import/export
   - Expand image types ... but especially exr
   - Standard data storage, say yaml ... can we get a binary format?

1. ### Area: Lighting
    - Gamma
    - Look at cinematographic techniques

1. ### Area: Fiducials
    - Logo and Picture => Fiducial tag
    - Networks that detects fiducials (tain)
       - "harness" to train
    - Add April Tags to OpenCV, with DNN detection
       - [April Tags are described here](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/)
          - Train MNet to segment tags to high performance
          - Move network into DNN
          - Feed the detections to the April Tag algorithm
       - **Difficulty** Hard. Must be able to train deep nets and use ONNX or other to port to DNN currated nets and then add a method for feeding in detected tags to the April tag algorithm (ported to OpenCV).

1. ### Area: SLAM/Camera Pose

   - **Difficulty** Extreme. Few people have the skills to get SLAM working well

1. ### Area: User Interface

   [HighGUI](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/dfc/group__highgui.html) is OpenCV's simple graphical user interface including event triggering. It's cool, but it's old. It needs expanding. 
   - We, the admins, actually place a high priority of getting the simple basic stuff to work well, so we very much encourage application to this project
   - HighGUI stands relatively alone and so can be easily changed without a deep knowledge of computer vision.
   - Some of its needs are:
      - Add simple buttons and sliders
      - It has an optional QT interface, but it involves some messy loading and linking into a very large external code base for what is relatively simple additional functionality.
         - Add the QT functionality (mainly zoom to pixel and snap shot) w/o the QT dependency; 
         - one option is to use OpenGL and draw various controls manually.
   - **Difficulty:** Medium. This is a lot of UI coding that can be done in very small, modular chunks (adding buttons for example).
   - "vector graphics" -- in a separate layer
   - Drag and drop a point (control point) that can be moved

1. ### Area: video encoding/decoding
   - Bringing significant improvements into gstreamer backend of videoio
   - Hardware-accelerated video codecs via libyami (https://github.com/01org/libyami)
   - Replacing jasper with openjpeg to encode and decode Jpeg 2000 images
   - Any other good suggestions/projects to reduce OpenCV dependency of ffmpeg
   - **Difficulty:** Hard. This involves knowledge of video codecs etc

1. ### Area: Human Tracking and Segmentation
   1. #### _IDEA:_ Facial Landmark Detector
      * ***Description:*** Facial feature detection and tracking is a high value area of computer vision since humans are interested in what humans are paying attention to, feeling, and enhancing face pictures in selfies etc. At this point, we feel this should just become a standard "built in" ability that computer vision users can just call/rely on. OpenCV already has some code available on for Facial Landmark detection, see [Tutorial on Facial Landmark Detector API](https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/d5/d47/tutorial_table_of_content_facemark.html) and  [Tutorials for face module](https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/de/d27/tutorial_table_of_content_face.html), but much progress has been made that we want to make available. The task is to create a Facial Landmark detector model with the following requirements:

      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         * For mobile, make available a smaller model with lesser points ( e.g. 5 instead of 68 )
         * Run at better Accuracy than Dlib
         * Face Stabilization ( filtering and optical flow )
         * Add it to the Python API

         * Resources
            * https://docs.opencv.org/4.0.0/d5/d47/tutorial_table_of_content_facemark.html

            * https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/face

      * ***Skills Required:*** mastery level C++ and Python, college course work in Computer Vision that includes work on face features. Best if you have worked with deep networks before.

      * ***Mentors:*** Vikas Gupta, Ankit Sachan
      * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

For students interested in applying
-----------------------------------

1.  You **must** already know how to program fluently in C++
    - Some projects may instead specifically require Python, javascript or Matlab skills
2.  Ask to join the opencv-gsoc mailing list above
    - Discuss projects ideas below or your own ideas with OpenCV mentors on the list.
    - Always title your proposal with what you want to do (example: *Implement Patch Match Stereo Algorithm* )
        - **NOTE:** The above is to discuss proposals with mentors. **BUT**, when the application period starts, you must still sign up with Google Summmer of Code and submit your proposal to the OpenCV organization. If not, you will not show up on the database where we can select you as a student.
3.  Sign up to be a student with OpenCV
4.  Post the project from below or your own agreed on project on the GSoC to opencv-gsoc mailing list above
    - Include Name, google email
    - Include how you think you are qualified to accomplish this project (skills, courses, relevant background)
    - Include Country of origin, school you are enrolled in, Professor you work with (if any)
    - Include a projected timeline and milestones for the project
5.  When (and if!) OpenCV gets accepted as GSoC org this year, and we are told how many slots we will get **and** you've signed up for a project with us, **Then:**
    - We will weigh the students and projects against the mentors we gather and the mentor's interests and choose which students/project to pursue.
    - Accepted students will be posted on the GSoC site (and we will notify the accepted students ourselves afterwards).
    - Students are paid over the summer by Google **IF** the mentor accepts the student's work. There are several milestone based go-nogo points as above.
6.  We've had a lot of experience with this: Please only propose projects that you already know how to do. 
    - It is impossible for a mentor to train you in how to do the task while helping you do it. This **always** results in failure.
    - Mentors exist to keep you on track, and ensure good code, but not to teach you a new area of vision or AI.
    - This is also not a _research_ period. If you are a top student with publications in top conferences from a top professor in a top University known to us, we may let you code your research area. This is rare.
    - Documentation, tests and tutorial are as vital as the code. We'd rather have rougher code then miss these items because if these are not in place, your code will be useless to everyone.

For computer vision professionals interested in mentoring
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  Contact us on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
4.  You then:
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through student project proposals, find a student and project you like and work with them to refine a realistic proposal that they can implement in a summer (you have to judge whether the student is capable - **you must verify that they can already code in the language (mostly C++) specified.** Summer is too short to learn to code and get something done).
        - you may also find (good) students and get them to apply, perhaps on your pet project idea
    - Once you find or create a project proposal that you want to mentor
        - several students might try for the same project
        - alternatively, you might have to convince a student to change projects to one you like or recruit an external student to join Google Summer of Code and apply to your project
    - But, always encourage students to officially apply through the Google Summer of Code site
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6.  Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
    - Sheesh!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable student **and** we give you a slot **and** the student signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations. 
   - Thank you for trying. 
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

It sounds harder than it is.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
