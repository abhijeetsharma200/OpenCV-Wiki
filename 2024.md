* Vadim & OpenCV China:
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao has tested CLblast on different machines. Normally, CLBlast's gemm is 1.15x-5x faster than OpenCV's OpenCL gemm (and faster than the new fast CPU gemm).
  * [OpenCV China] Optimization of transformers goes on. Yuantao has profiled VIT inference. Apparently, GELU takes >10%; there is also surprisingly expensive Constant node (2-3%) and Transpose node (that can be fused with preceding or following MatMu/GEMM).
  * [OpenCV China] Wanli is working on replacing Darknet models with ONNX. Yolo models have been converted and seemingly work well, but post-processing in the tests needs to be updated to make the tests pass.
* Gary:
  * GSoC 2024: application period starts next week. Need to prepare the list of ideas.
  * Q: new camera calibration - what is it about? does it support Charuco as calibration rig? A by Alexander S: in theory, Charuco is supported, but there are some issues with it, it still requires some work.   
* Vincent:
  * no big updates; opened issue related to animation support (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/24855).
* Vladimir D:
  * Finally finished with 1D signal resampling func in OpenCV contrib.
  * Additionally, working on integration of T-Head changes to support their RISC-V toolchain 2.8.1
* Dmitry M (Intel):
  * asked question about customizing CI jobs (e.g. to test fresh OpenVINO)
* Alexander S (opencv.ai):
  * Abduragim Shtanchaev: on vacation
  * Done:
    * Alexander Smorkalov:
      * Prepared 4.x -> 5.x merge for commits up to 4.9.0
      * Debugged and fixed out-of-memory access in Yolo-NAS test (#24809, 24861)
      * Prepared OpenCV 5.x core [update plan](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nefi1QqfOWFhDZ1hu7xA4OvnLsYKAUi4igzSflmAnA/edit#gid=0) for new types support.
      * Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with ## 24869, 24868, 24860, 24773, 24813, 24873, 24874, 24768, 24459, 24567, 24864, 24856, 24852, 24849, 24842, 24812, 24830 contrib ##3618, 3615, 3616
    * Alexander Panov:
      * Prepared PR Fix generateImage for charuco chessboard [#24873](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24873)
      * Improve accuracy of generation chessboard, added test
      * Review and commented #24558
      * Works on moving Aruco tutorials and samples to main repo [#23018](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23018)
    * Rostislav Vasilikhin:
      * Finalized rasterization PR from GSoC 2023 ([#24459](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24459))
      * Works on Point Could Compression PR ([#24197](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24197))
    * Alexander Lyulkov:
      * Added screen rotation support to Android JavaCameraView, JavaCamera2View and NativeCameraView. Added screen rotation support to tutorial1 and face-detection Android samples.
      * Added javadoc compilation in AAR creating script
      * Works on Kotlin dependency in SDK and published AAR packages

## 2024-01-10

* Vadim & OpenCV China:
  * Several PRs with DNN improvements and bug fixes have been submitted.
  * Found very interesting CLblast project - will possibly use it to accelerate OpenCL backend of OpenCV DNN.
  * There is "sort-of-successful" attempt to run CLIP model using OpenCV. 1/2 models (the visual part) is run using OpenCV, the other model (textual part) is now running using ONNXruntime. Can be a nice project to enable the whole thing in OpenCV.
  * Looking for ways to provide better out-of-the-box performance of OpenCV Python @ Intel.
  * GSoC 2024 is approaching, time to start preparations.
* Gary:
  * working on defining the next directions for OpenCV.
* Vincent:
  * 4.9.0 has been tested internally.
  * working on animation support in webp codec in OpenCV.
* Alexander (opencv.ai):
  * Done:
    * 4.9.0 is out just before new year. The changelog is here, as usual: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog.
    * Abduragim Shtanchaev:
      * Finished 1d Vector operation support in Einsum. PR[ #24830](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24830)
      * Added FastBatchedGemm for Einsum. PR [#24812](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24812)
      * Added yolo-nas test PR [#24309](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24809). Works on memory corruption issue in parser.
      * Solved issue with concat layer on CUDA [#24786](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24786)
    * Alexander Smorkalov:
      * Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with ## 24829, 24765, 24799, 24828, 24823, 24819, 24820, 24783, 24815, 24801, 24807, 24814
