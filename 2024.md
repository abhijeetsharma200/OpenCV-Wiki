## 2024-08-14

* Vadim:
  ...
* Shiqi:
  * GIF encoder and decoder are ready for review; there are regression tests. encoder of true-color images is also ready, it uses some color quantization.
* Alexander S (opencv.ai):
  * GSoC:
    * Initial support for GTK3 + OpenGL in HighGUI is enabled. Support for GTK4 is just started. Also, there are some conflicts with the current OpenGL support in core module.
  * others:
    * Abduragim Shtanchaev:
      * Finished Python boolean bindings issue. [#26026 ](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/26026)
      * Figured issue where CUDA would fall back on CPU [#26021 ](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/26021)
      * Working on issue with Einsum layer 1d falling NEON backend
    * Alexander Smorkalov:
      * Disabled quantize-dequantize tests with CUDA after 4.x->5.x merge #26050.
      * Fixed memory leak in dshow camera backend #26045.
      * Finished JS support for opencv_contrib #25986.
      * Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues ## 25950, 26052, 25968, 26043, 26048, 26009, 26026, 26046, 26038, 26034, 26041, 25980, 26019
      * Working on adding support for bool type into various places in OpenCV, e.g. to be able to use boolean mask (CV_Bool) in every place where CV_8U mask is now expected.
    * Alexander Lyulkov:
      * Added integer types to OpenCL dnn backend  [#26048](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/26048)
    * Rostislav Vasilikhin:
      * Fixed rounding mode for test: [#26052](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/26052)

## 2024-08-14

* Vadim:
  * [OpenCV China] there is some progress with warpAffine optimization; more types (F32, F16) and more channel options (C=1, C=4) will be added. warpPerspective will be done in a separate PR. It looks like double-precision division is needed to compute coordinates accurately enough in the case of warpPerspective.
  * [OpenCV China] GSoC project on block-wise quantization goes well. The first PR has been merged. Now the student will concentrate on fixing ONNX loader to handle blockwise-quantized models efficiently (move all dequantization steps outside of the inference loop)
  * Wanli finished work on v_exp, v_log, v_erf; now finalizing work on v_sin, v_cos, v_sincos.
  * GSoC: just ~2 weeks left before "soft" code freeze, 3 weeks before "hard" code freeze.
* Shiqi:
  * GSoC student mostly finished GIF encoder; decoder was finished earlier. Both parts are ready for review.
  * Presented information about OpenCV, mostly DNN module, at the conference in Vietnam. ~100 participants, ~50% of them use OpenCV.
* Gary:
  * GSoC students should prepare docker image with the 3D reconstruction framework/demo and the respective demonstration video.

* Vadim:
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao collected profile of ViT inference pipeline; looks like there are many opportunities to speed it up, like avoid repetitive memory allocation, optimizing GELU activation, optimizing SoftMax (maybe implementing FlashAttention), optimizing a few other layers besides matrix multiplication. Now Yuantao is also working on preparing CLBast-derived OpenCL MatMul and batch MatMul kernels for DNN (including the case when one of the matrix is constant).

* Vadim & OpenCV China:
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao has tested CLblast on different machines. Normally, CLBlast's gemm is 1.15x-5x faster than OpenCV's OpenCL gemm (and faster than the new fast CPU gemm).
  * [OpenCV China] Optimization of transformers goes on. Yuantao has profiled VIT inference. Apparently, GELU takes >10%; there is also surprisingly expensive Constant node (2-3%) and Transpose node (that can be fused with preceding or following MatMu/GEMM).
  * [OpenCV China] Wanli is working on replacing Darknet models with ONNX. Yolo models have been converted and seemingly work well, but post-processing in the tests needs to be updated to make the tests pass.
* Gary:
  * GSoC 2024: application period starts next week. Need to prepare the list of ideas.
  * Q: new camera calibration - what is it about? does it support Charuco as calibration rig? A by Alexander S: in theory, Charuco is supported, but there are some issues with it, it still requires some work.   
* Vincent:
  * no big updates; opened issue related to animation support (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/24855).
