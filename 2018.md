   * We gave an extensive tutorial at the Open Software Foundation 
   * Material for [OpenCV Tutorial is here](https://github.com/xperience-ai/oreilly_opencv_workshop2018)
      * This covers the use of the [OpenCV Deep Neural Net Module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/dnn) that is able to run inference on any trained deepnet model
         * A growing list of [curated deep neural network models for DNN is here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn)
         * [DNN Documentation is here](https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/d2/d58/tutorial_table_of_content_dnn.html)
       * See some of the opencv deepnet (DNN) tutorial for [pose](https://github.com/xperience-ai/oreilly_opencv_workshop2018/blob/master/python/DeepLearning/pose/OpenPose.ipynb) and [object detection](https://github.com/xperience-ai/oreilly_opencv_workshop2018/blob/master/python/DeepLearning/object_detection/tf_object_detection.ipynb)
* OpenCV 4
   * Release 3.4.2 is out, see [notes here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/ChangeLog#version342) with further extended dnn module, documentation improvements, some other new functionality and bug fixes.

![](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/images/dnn.png)

-   DNN 3.4.2 improvements

    - Added a new computational target `DNN_TARGET_OPENCL_FP16` for half-precision floating point arithmetic of deep learning networks using OpenCL. Just use `net.setPreferableTarget(DNN_TARGET_OPENCL_FP16)`.
    - Extended support of Intel's Inference Engine backend to run models on GPU (OpenCL FP32/FP16) and VPU (Myriad 2, FP16) devices. See [an installation guide](Intel%27s-Deep-Learning-Inference-Engine-backend) for details.
    - Enabled import of [Intel's OpenVINO pre-trained networks](https://software.intel.com/openvino-toolkit/documentation/pretrained-models) from intermediate representation (IR).
    - Introduced custom layers support which let you define unimplemented layers or override existing ones. Learn more in [a corresponding tutorial](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/dc/db1/tutorial_dnn_custom_layers.html).
    - Implemented a new deep learning [sample](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/3.4/samples/dnn/text_detection.cpp) inspired by [EAST: An Efficient and Accurate Scene Text Detector](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155v2).
    - Added a support of YOLOv3 and image classification models from [Darknet framework](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/).
    - Reduced top DNN's memory consumption and improvements in support of networks from TensorFlow and Keras.
   * 4.0 will come out in the Fall.

## __*Agenda*__
* OSVF
* OpenCV4
* OSCON


### *__Minutes__*
* **OSVF**
   * OSVF is an umbrella foundation covering the following organizations
      * [**OpenCV.org**](http://opencv.org/) -- Free and Open Source Computer Vision code plus optimized deep learning
      * [**Open3D.org**](http://open3d.org/)  -- Free and Open 3D point cloud library code
      * [**CARLA.org**](http://carla.org/) -- Free and Open autonomous driving simulator
      * [**SVDLG**](http://www.svdlg.com/) -- Silicon Valley Deep Learning Group
      * Each of these orgs will retain their identity and will be run wholly by their own technical boards, but will cooperate to build a greater whole
       * Their responsibilities are to advance and maintain their respective platforms
   * OSVF is responsible for
      * Education:
         * Put on the Computer Vision Developer's Conference (CVdevcon)
            * CVdevcon will be distinctly different from other vision conferences
               * If will be largely tutorial, development and business focused
               * It will have an "unconference component" meant to facilitate business, solve outstanding vision issues, set standards/challenges adopt certifications etc
      * Run tutorial workshops
      * Develop courseware, hardware and software kits for learning intelligent computer vision
      * Infrastructure: 
         * Oversee and help the orgs maintain and advance free and open tools and infrastructure for intelligent computer vision
      * Standards and Certification: 
         * Drive standards and hardware/software certifications that help society absorb computer vision
      * Solve Problems: 
         * Set challenges and contests to solve significant problems in computer vision with beneficial impact for society
* **OpenCV4.0**
   * Coordinated delayed to Sept timeframe better align with other projects
   * Some of the changes are in or showing up in the 3.4 branch
   * It is still possible that there will be some earlier alpha releases so that it's "pre hardened"
* **OSCON (Open Source Convention)**
   * OpenCV is giving a tutorial there, [see the tutorial link](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/68133), Description:
   > _"Gary Bradski, Anna Petrovicheva, and Satya Mallick offer an overview of OpenCV and explain where it is going. Along the way, youâ€™ll learn how to program some fun things that can be used for art, robotics, drones, film, and photography."_
   * Gary is going to also use it to announce the Open Source Vision Foundation

### *__To Dos__*

## 2018-06-27

## __*Agenda*__
* OSVF
* OSCON


### *__Minutes__*
* OSVF
   * Bylaws and foundation documents are signed and with Adler and Colvin
   * Raising preliminary funds (about $20K committed) for formation expenses
   * Initial board: Gary, Vladlen, Achin, Vadim, Qian-Yi and German
      * Then each project, OpenCV, Open3D and CARLA will have their own technical boards to set development
   * Logo ideas:  Third eye (but camera?) but work in Kaniza triangle (but in 3D?) and neon color spreading
      * [Third eye theme](https://www.dreamstime.com/stock-illustration-third-eye-vector-mystical-sign-image61575538) ... oh, some symbolism that ultimately we are creating code for perception, not vision ... perception is what the mind makes of sensory stimuli. Also, CARLA is somewhat fabricating the mind's eye vision
      * [Illusory triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illusory_contours#/media/File:Kanizsa_triangle.svg) Because perception is much more than vision -- we impose (causal) models on the world and the eventual smart machines must do so too.
      * [But lift the triangle to illusory 3D](http://illusionoftheyear.com/2011/05/impossible-illusory-triangle/) because, we are dealing with a 3D world ... and also Open3D!
* OSCON
   * We are going to give a course at OSCON
   * [Fun in detail with OpenCV](https://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/oscon-or/public/schedule/detail/68133)

## 2018-02-28

## __*Agenda*__
* Org docs
* OSCON
* OpenCV 4

### *__Minutes__*

* Org docs
   * Gary sent around to the nominal future board a document about amending and restating OpenCV.org
   * Once Gary gathers feedback, this will go to Adler & Colvin (legal firm that specializes in non-profit filings) to file federally
   * Key points:
      * Org will host the code, programmers and offer support packages/instant bug fix for the library
      * Org will advance the state of vision via developing algorithms and/or more useful APIs
      * Org will run gatherings: workshops, conferences, hackathons, educational events
      * Org may offer courseware
      * Org may offer smart camera HW/SW kits
         * For education
         * For contests (First Robotics)
         * For public demonstrations
         * For art
      *  Can host datasets for contests, reference, challenges/awards
         * Possibly labeling tools
      * Will be able to offer certification services for cameras, software or combinations
* OSCON
   * We've been asked to do a 3 hour tutorial at OSCON 2018. This is in preparation with Anna Petrovicheva of Xperience.ai
* OpenCV 4.0
   * Out this summer, much more seamless support for deep nets.
   * To set future direction of the library, we are going to 
      * use something like the [swift evolution list](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/tree/master/proposals)
     * suggested [opencv evolution format here](https://github.com/vpisarev/opencv/wiki/OpenCV-Evolution-Proposals)
     * adding in some from [GSoC ideas format](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list)
   * Consider adding some frameworks: Object detection: take frame by frame, rectangles w/confidence on output

### *__To Dos__*
* Gary
  - [ ] ~~Org setup~~ -- too vague, break it down above
* Vadim
  - [x] Ask Maxime (spelling?) how to add images to the OpenCV wiki/website. Now that it is GIT based, you have to link to an image somewhere, can be a specialized GIT repository for this.

## __*Agenda*__
* _**Happy Valentines Day!**_
* New meeting time, **9:30am Wednesday Californa time**
* GSoC
* Idea list
* Org structure

### *__Minutes__*
* **GSoC** 
   * Didn't get in this year ... we suppose the reasons (in order):
      1. Our ideas list was not [compliant](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list) ... no real excuses but: 
         * We are an older org, so only one grad student on our board, the rest are all working full-time professionals and/or running companies etc and we just picked up on the email warning about Google being serious about this item this year too late.
         * As with most of these items, one problem is that we've been in for many years and were just following patterns that had worked, but some things have changed, the emphasis on this is one, another rating point in the summer and so on.
         * _Corrective:_ is simply below -- make the list compliant 
      1. We were late in the 2017 mid-summer student rating, again, no excuse, but we were in the pattern from the previous year where this didn't exist and several of us just happened to be traveling.
         * _Corrective:_ (1) Is to make sure this doesn't happen, (2) I'm trying to get more money into the org so that we can hire some full time staff who can keep up with the greater demands on the org.
      1. We've been in for years -- they might have also decided we needed a kick/or to just rotate us out
         * _Corrective:_ Just apply again next year.
* **Idea List**
   * Have to get compliant with [Defining a Project Ideas list from the Mentor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list)
*  **Org Structure**
   * Traffic is up, OpenCV 4.0 is coming out this summer, we have major new content to digest from opencv_contrib and particularly incorporation of of the [deep neural network module DNN](https://docs.opencv.org/3.3.0/d2/d58/tutorial_table_of_content_dnn.html).
   * It's time to take the running of the org up a level:
      1. Refile the federal non-profit status, include hosting standards such as
         * Certifying camera/smart camera modules
         * Image datasets standards
         * Selling or partnering for education kits
      1. Recruiting or changing over to a more professional business and technical board
      1. Changing law firms to a bigger/scarier law firm that has offered to handle this pro-bono
      1. Recruiting a business manager and probably admin
      1. There is promised funding for some of this, need to convert promises to checks
      1. As a stretch goal, maybe run OpenCV Summer of Code at a small level this year:
         * DNN tutorial/ONNX to work well with ingesting major deep platform networks.
         * python
         * highGUI
* OSCON
   * Asked for a 3 hour tutorial ... Need to see if we can find someone to help or turn it down. Would like to say "yes"
* Open3D
   * Will be meeting with [vladlen koltun](http://vladlen.info/) about Open3D on Feb 15th

### *__To Dos__*

## __*Agenda*__
* GSoC Projects, mentors

### *__Minutes__*

* Now applied to GSoC
![OpenCV GSoC2018](https://github.com/garybradski/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/tutorial_code/images/done.png)
* GSoC Projects, mentors
   * tiny-dnn and DNN
      * How to resolve DNN and tiny-dnn
      * DNN runs inference 
      * ONNX
      * Integration with [TVM](http://tvmlang.org/) ... relationship to Halide
         * [Good timings](http://www.tvmlang.org/2018/01/16/opt-mali-gpu.html) 
* Opencv 4.0 
   * DNN integrated into core as a central function
   * Somethings move to conrib
* Geometric vision differences with deep learning
   * Deep learning 
* DNN runs inference 
   * Will stay in OpenCV
   * Will not have any dependencies
   * Can add extensions ... needs NVidia
   * 4 backends: 
      * C++ +intrinsics optimizations; 
      * OpenCL; 
      * Halide; 
      * DL Inference engine
      * Can we just open to different backends to allow extensions to NVidia, ARM?
         * [TVM](http://tvmlang.org/)?
            * But whole LLVM is in it
* deep ideas:
   * it would be nice to have self-contained ONNX importer (using libprotobuf?).
   * some network compression algorithms, probably including quantization and factorization-based methods (where compression algorithm itself can be implemented as pytorch or Caffe2 or TF script, but then OpenCV probably needs to be extended to parse such compressed networks).
   * we would also be interested in adding new layers that would help to support new interesting topologies. In particular, it would be cool to have supported some compact networks for text detection and for background segmentation, maybe shadow elimination, tracking etc. or whatever Yann considers to be worthy.
