# Ideas:

1. #### _IDEA:_ Audiovisual speech recognition demo
   * ***Description:*** Last summer we brought support for audio I/O and some speech recognition models into OpenCV. This time we want to add more speech recognition examples. One particularly interesting demo would be to recognize speech using joint video+audio input, i.e. use video feed as extra data to improve speech recognition
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Demo that reads video + audio using OpenCV API, analyzes speech and prints the recognized text in realtime in console or separate UI window.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Audiovisual Speech Recognition & Lipreading](https://paperswithcode.com/task/lipreading)
   * ***Skills Required:*** training and using deep learning; basic to good knowledge of NLP; good C++/Python coding skills.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Batanina Liubov
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ FP16 Compute Paths in OpenCV DNN
   * ***Description:*** Some modern CPUs include hardware support for FP16 arithmetics, which can be used to accelerate various algorithms including computational photography and deep learning inference. OpenCV includes basic support for FP16 data format, but there is no any FP16 compute paths in OpenCV deep learning module. It's suggested to add some basic FP16 kernels to accelerate OpenCV DNN, in particular, convolutions (depth-wise, 1x1, 3x3 ...) and transposed convolutions, max pooling, element-wise operations. The graph engine in OpenCV DNN should be modified to insert FP16<=>FP32 conversions when needed. FP16 compute paths can be utilized either automatically, when the loaded model contains FP16 or INT8 weights, or explicitly, when user sets FP16 precision. Special measures should be taken to preserve accuracy of the original FP32 models. *It's fine to re-use existing kernels from other deep learning engines as long as they have proper license (BSD, MIT, Apache 2).*
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Series of patches for OpenCV DNN that add support for FP16 into the inference pipeline, the actual operations and the graph engine.
      * Updated OpenCV DNN units tests to test the performance and accuracy of FP16 compute paths
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Tencent NCNN with FP16 & BF16 support](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/tree/master/src/layer/arm)
      * [Alibaba MNN with FP16 support](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN/tree/master/source/backend/arm82/asm/arm64)
      * [XNNPack with lots of FP16 kernels](https://github.com/google/XNNPACK/tree/master/src)
   * ***Skills Required:*** good software optimization skills, fluent C++ and ARM Assembly, basic understanding of deep learning inference engines
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Improved imgcodecs
   * ***Description:*** It's not a single big project but rather a series of tasks under the "image codecs" umbrella. The goal is to make a series of improvements in the existing opencv_imgcodecs module, including, but not limited to, the following items (please, feel free to propose your ideas):
     * replace libpng with much more compact and equally efficient [libspng](https://github.com/randy408/libspng/)
     * probably, insert some bits of [pngcrush](https://pmt.sourceforge.io/pngcrush/) into png encoder to achieve better compression
     * enable inline assembly in libjpeg-turbo in order to boost performance.
     * provide optional bit-exactness tests for OpenCV jpeg decoder to make sure that we can read jpeg images and get the same results on each platform. Those tests should only be invoked when OpenCV is built with some known version of libjpeg.
     * provide extra API to read image header separately from the image data (probably, it should be a callback or something like that provided, or there should be some optional limits for image resolution).
     * finalize multi-page image decoder with convenient C++ and Python API: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/17753 
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Series of patches for OpenCV imgcodecs
   * ***Resources:***
      * *TBD*
   * ***Skills Required:*** practical expertise in C++ and image codecs.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky, Suleyman Turkmen
   * ***Difficulty:*** Easy to Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ Ficus Bindings
   * ***Description:*** Extend OpenCV bindings for Ficus programming language to cover more modules. Preferably create a script to generate bindings automatically. Add more examples to use OpenCV from Ficus.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Patches for ficus OpenCV bindings to bring in more functionality
      * Several OpenCV C++/Python examples converted to Ficus
      * Documentation (probably, a chapter in the Ficus tutorial)
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Ficus at Github](https://github.com/vpisarev/ficus); inside the doc directory you may find the tutorial.
      * [Current Ficus OpenCV bindings](https://github.com/vpisarev/ficus/blob/master/lib/OpenCV.fx)
      * [Object detection example in Ficus](https://github.com/vpisarev/ficus/blob/master/examples/objdetect.fx) that contains build instructions
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery experience coding in C/C++, basic knowledge of functional languages, such as Ocaml, SML, Haskell, Rust.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium (without automatic bindings generator) to Hard (with the automatic generator)

1. #### _IDEA:_ Point Cloud Compression
   * ***Description:*** Implement algorithm(s) to compress point clouds and optionally compress meshes. In OpenCV 5.x there is new  [3D module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/5.x/modules/3d) that contains algorithms for 3D data processing. Point cloud is one of the fundamental representations of 3D data and there is growing number of point cloud processing functions, including I/O, RANSAC-based registration, plane fitting etc. Point cloud compression is another desired functionality to add, where we throw away some points from the cloud while preserving the overall geometry that the point cloud implicitly describes.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Point cloud compression algorithm developed for OpenCV 3d module (need to follow OpenCV coding style)
      * Unit tests and at least 1 example in C++ or Python that demonstrates the functionality
      * Documentation/tutorial on how to use this functionality.
      * (optional, but desired) optional integration of OpenCV with [Google's Draco](https://github.com/google/draco) library that provides rich functionality for 3D data compression.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Point cloud compression tutorial from Pointclouds library](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/compression.html)
      * [Introduction to point cloud compression by ZTE](https://res-www.zte.com.cn/mediares/magazine/publication/com_en/article/201803/XUYiling.pdf)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery experience coding in C/C++, good understanding of clustering algorithms and, more generally, 3D data processing algorithms.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Rostislav Vasilikhin
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium to Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Simple triangle rendering
   * ***Description:*** Some 3D algorithms require mesh rendering as their inner part, for example as a feedback for 3d reconstruction. Depending on algorithm type, a depth or a color rendering is required. This function can also be used as a simple debugging tool. Since light, shadows and correct texture rendering are separate huge problems, they are out of scope for this task.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * A function that takes as input a set of points, a set of indices that form triangles and produces depth rendering as output
      * Per-vertex color support is desirable. In that case a function should also take vertex colors as input and produce RGB output
      * Optional: accelerated version using SIMD, OpenCL or OpenGL
      * Optional: jacobians of input parameters as a base for neural rendering
  * ***Resources:***
         * [Triangle rasterization tutorial](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/rasterization-stage)
         * [3D module in OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/next/modules/3d)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; basic skills of optimizing code using SIMD; basic knowledge of 3D math
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Rostislav Vasilikhin
   * ***Difficulty:*** Easy to Medium, depending on chosen task scope

1. #### _IDEA:_ Demo for Android
   * ***Description:*** Computer vision on mobile phones is a very popular topic for many years already. Several years ago we added support for mobile platforms (Android and iOS) into OpenCV. Now it's time to refresh and update the corresponding parts (build scripts, examples, tutorials). Let's use the formula: Modern Android + OpenCV + OpenCV Deep learning module + camera (maybe even use depth sensor on phones that have it). It can be a really cool project that will show your skills that that will be extremely helpful for many OpenCV users.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Demo app for Android with all the source code available, no binary blobs or proprietary components.
      * The app should preferably be native (in C++).
      * The app can use camera via native Android API for via OpenCV API. The latter is preferable, but not necessary.
      * The app must use OpenCV DNN module. It should run some deep net using OpenCV and visualize the results (e.g. draw rectangles around found objects, the fancier visualization — the better).
      * The app should work in realtime on any reasonably fast phone. If it's slow, it's better to choose some lighter net or run it on a lower resolution.
      * Preferably the app should not be tightly bound to a particular model. For example, if it's object detection demo, it should be possible to replace one model with another, not via UI, just replace the model file and put the new model name into a config file or into source code.
      * There should be a short tutorial (a markdown file with the key code fragments and some screenshot on how to build it and run.
      * There should be some efforts applied (see https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Compact-build-advice) to make the application compact. That was a separate request from various OpenCV users, and a compact mobile app would be the best example how to do that.
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery experience coding in C/C++ and/or Java, practical experience with developing apps for Android. At least basic understanding of computer vision and deep learning technologies, enough to run a deep net and make it run at realtime speed.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium to Hard

# **Contributors**

## **How to Apply**

The process is described at [GSoC home page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)

## **How contributors will be evaluated once working:**

- Contributors will be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of contribution
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has all or most of the planned functionality (but still usable without those missing parts)
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has some unit tests
            - Has a tutorial/sample of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
       - Optionally, but highly desirable: create a (short! 30sec-1min) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your project. We will use it to create the final video:
            - [The 2021 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6He1Ay7hfQc)
            - [The 2020 Movie](https://youtu.be/ROGa2tutPHQ)
            - [The 2015 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s)
            - [The 2014 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA)
            - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)
    - **Extended period:**
        - TBD

-----------------

# Mentors:

1.  Contact us, preferably in February or early March, on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * [Mentor only list](https://groups.google.com/g/opencv_mentors)
       * [The Contributor+Mentor Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2022)
4.  You then:
    - Look through the ideas above, choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through the project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen.
       - Find likely contributors, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of contributors who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a contributor or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your contributors officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) prior to the deadline as indicate by the Contributor Application Period in the [time line](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2022#important-dates)
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6. Contributors must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable contributor **and** we give you a slot **and** the contributor signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations.
   - Thank you for trying.
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
