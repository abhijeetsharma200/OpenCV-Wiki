All work is in C++ unless otherwise noted.

# Ideas:

1. #### _IDEA:_ Idea title
   * ***Description:*** short description.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * Outcome 1.
      * Outcome 2.
   * ***Resources:***
      * wheere to start from, which 3rd-party software is recommended to use
   * ***Skills Required:*** C++, Python, ML, Kung-fu ...
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Mentor #1, Mentor #2
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard ("no free lunch")

----
### _Idea Template:_
```
1. #### _IDEA:_ <Descriptive Title>
   * ***Description:*** 3-7 sentences describing the task
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * < Short bullet list describing what is to be accomplished >
      * <i.e. create a new module called "bla bla">
      * < Has method to accomplish X >
      * <...>
  * ***Resources:***
         * [For example a paper citation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08091.pdf)
         * [For example an existing feature request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/11013)
         * [Possibly an existing related module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/optflow) that includes some new optical flow algorithms.
   * ***Skills Required:*** < for example mastery plus experience coding in C++, college course work in vision that covers optical flow, python. Best if you have also worked with deep neural networks. >
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** < your name goes here >
   * ***Difficulty:*** <Easy, Medium, Hard>
```

----

* ## **All Ideas Above**
   1. #### Have these Additional Expected Outcomes:
      * Use the [OpenCV How to Contribute](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute) and [Aruco module in opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco) as a guide.
      * Add unit tests [described here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/QA_in_OpenCV), see also the [Aruco test example](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/test)
      * Add a tutorial, and sample code
         * see the [Aruco tutorials](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/tutorials) and how they [look on the web](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/d6d/tutorial_table_of_content_aruco.html).
         * See the [Aruco samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/samples)
      * Make a short video showing off your algorithm and post it to Youtube. [Here's an Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5P65CYqo_Q).

# **Contributors**

## **How to Apply**

The process is described at [GSoC home page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)

## **How contributors will be evaluated once working:**

- Contributors will be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of contribution
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has all or most of the planned functionality (but still usable without those missing parts)
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has some unit tests
            - Has a tutorial/sample of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
       - Optionally, but highly desirable: create a (short! 30sec-1min) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your project. We will use it to create the final video:
            - [The 2021 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6He1Ay7hfQc)
            - [The 2020 Movie](https://youtu.be/ROGa2tutPHQ)
            - [The 2015 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s)
            - [The 2014 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA)
            - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)
    - **Extended period:**
        - TBD

-----------------

# Mentors:

1.  Contact us, preferably in February or early March, on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * [The Mentor Only Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv_mentors_2022)
       * [The Contributor+Mentor Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2022)
4.  You then:
    - Look through the ideas above, choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through the project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen.
       - Find likely contributors, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of contributors who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a contributor or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your contributors officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) prior to the deadline as indicate by the Contributor Application Period in the [time line](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2022#important-dates)
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6. Contributors must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable contributor **and** we give you a slot **and** the contributor signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations.
   - Thank you for trying.
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
