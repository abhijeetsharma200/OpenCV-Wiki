## __*Agenda*__
* Browser
* GSoC
* Updates

### *__Minutes__*
* Browser -- the below can help make vision integral to browsers that we may engage with
   * Talk with Mozilla about this (GSoC project? Probably too involved or complex)
      * WebGPU (working group inside W3C), 
      * WebAssembly (expand WebAssembly outside of the browser, Byte code alliance, WASI standard -- extensions) 
      * WebSIMD (in progress, efforts happening, but few people. Extraction layer over SIMD, threading, long vector instruction)
      * Compiler for optimization/vision OpenNP, LLDM (GSoC) ... but looks maybe too big for a student
* GSoC
   * Application is already complete
   * [Ideas list](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2020#opencv-project-ideas-list)
      * Now 15 ideas, the application is complete
      * Adding Tensor flow connection idea
      * OpenNP lldm ... use compiler to optimize vision in browser
         * But probably too complex for a student project
   * We have strong people for overhauling RANSAC. OpenCV foundation may extend student support for this beyond GSoC
* China team
   * Paused by Chinese new year and Coronavirus
   * OpenLabs startup w/ARM in China (OpenCV DNN acceleration for ARM, was for Feb, but might be delayed by coronavirus)
   * Looking for extra engineers ... again delayed
   * HW for build factory ... also delayed
   * Shiqui ... discussing adapting courseware. Not delayed since can be done at home
* Kickstarter for features or toolboxes
   * We should come up with a list we can try this
* Hackathon
   * Feb 2nd
   * Set up a "thankyou" page, and post hackathon thanks
   * Can send now to mailing list and blog list

* **Update**
   * RISC-V close to RISC pipe committee (they may be the mentors for the idea)
   * Down to 62 pull requests, now more new than old pull requests
      * Probably need to track the average age of pull requests soon
   * Make sure every pull requests is attended to
      * Make a formal process for the response -- what's wrong, what to do if abandoned by the contributor
      * Looking into other projects, how they do it: finding -- no formal processes. Linux is just by fiat by the main guy
         * We want aliveness response
         * Check that it's 3.4 or later
   * What should be done for a pull requests
   * Preparing for hackathon, can provide list

1. Vadim Pisarevsky could not join today. The first and second agenda items were skipped.
2. Hackathon announcement has been published on [opencv.org](http://opencv.org/). Thanks, Satya for post promotion.
3. PR handling process was discussed with Alexander Alekhin. Major items:
   - Stale bot produces to many spam e-mails for maintainer, very detailed configuration is required. The idea is postponed.
   - 2 weeks is too short to wait for PR author, e.g. maintainer or author vacations.
   - We can add a checklist and links to test examples directly to the PR template. It's a useful solution and works as a reminder. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov proposes an alternative PR template.
   - Proposed new tag "Discussion Required" for PRs. All PRs with the tag are discussed by the core team before actual review and integration. The tag is designed for PRs with suspicious changes, PRs with small value and changes that breaks existing logic or API. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov introduce the tag on Github and add notes to the Contribution guide.
4. PRs discussion status:
   - optimize cvCeil and cvFloor in fase_math.hpp #16160 -- closed as incomplete; no author replies on questions.
   - core: Workaround flip horiz [#16152](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16152) -- the PR highlights memory alignment issue on ARM v7 for vectorized code. The PR cannot be merged as-is. AI to @Alekhin, Alexander to file a ticket with a detailed description, propose an alternative solution and then close the original PR.
   - Add package for CMake project #16322 -- The patch rejected as we do not maintain it and most of package management systems store metafiles and extra patches on their side.
   - Fix bugs in arithm_op() for InputArray (src == dst) case. #13570 -- To be discussed with Vadim Pisarevsky.
   - export IMG decoders/encoders #8511 -- To be discussed with Vadim Pisarevsky.

## __*Agenda*__

### *__Minutes__*

My notes from the meeting today:
1. The team agreed  WW06 (Feb 2-9) as a preliminary timeframe for OpenCV Hackathon. @A lexander S morkalov  and @V adim L evin will create short list of tickets for the hackathon for the next meeting.
2. V adim L evin has done serious cv::VideoCapture refactoring that breaks compatibility. AI to @A lekhin, A lexander and @V adim P isarevsky to review PR to discuss the solution on the next meeting.
3. Most of fixes from V adim L evin for Python bindings have been merged. @V adim L evin will split remaining PR on 2: existing bug fixes and new functionality. The second one will be discussed later.
4. Abandoned PRs:
- BFGS and L-BFGS optimization methods: AI to @A lexander S morkalov  to close. The implementation is buggy.
- Clang format: AI to @A lekhin, A lexander to close the PR with comments. The formatter introduces a lot of changes in code and some of them are not well readable.
- Objdetect module const correctness: AI to @A lekhin, Alexander to close the PR and related ticket with resolution "will not fix". Some object detectors are not constant by design and not thread safe. We can force detectors interface and overcome mutability problem with thread local variables and other C++ hacks, but it introduces non-obvious behavior.
5. OpenCV 5.0 is planned for release in June-July time frame. The release is aligned to 20th anniversary of the project.
6. A lexander S morkalov started document to collect common replies to PRs: AI to @A lekhin, A lexander  to join and extend the document.
