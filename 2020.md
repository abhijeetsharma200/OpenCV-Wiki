   * Working on 1D pooling
   * Wrote tutorial about using Orbbec's Astra cameras.
   * 100+ => 89 open pull requests.
* Gary:
   * AprilTag detector is still in progress. It's pretty solid now. Autorotation on Android brings in some difficulties.
* Alexander:
   * 2 trackers: GoTurn & MIL have been moved to the main repository; KCF is not moved yet because of the big binary blob used (>3.5Mb)
   * dnnModel class has been refactored
   * the team is preparing OpenCV 4.5.1 and 3.4.13 released.
   * one bug in core, reported by Vincent, has been fixed.
* Vincent:
   * 2 efforts: C API => C++ API, updating OpenCV 2.x to 4.x. k-means API has changed between 2.x and 4.x and it was the only API that required changes.

1. Vadim:
   - GSoC: the final evaluation for students has started. Need to ask the students to submit the final evaluation form.
   - GSoC: Julia bindings project is 100% finished; the final video was received. Article for the blog is in progress.
   - GSoC: RANSAC project is 100% finished. The final video was received. Article for the blog is in progress.
   - Discussed DNN project evolution for OpenCV 5. There probably be no radical refactoring of the module in OpenCV 5 (e.g. towards NGraph-like architecture), however there are going to be some important improvements:
       - reworked importers, especially ONNX importer.
       - an external utility that will do careful network diagnostic and probably some transformations to simplify its use within OpenCV.
       - probably an updated layer fusion part that will do multi-pass fusion.
       - python samples could automatically download and store in some "cache" missing deep learning models.
       - even better CUDA/cuDNN support, maybe via dynamically loaded "plugin", similar to opencv_ffmpeg, dynamically loaded FFMPEG wrapper plugin on Windows.
   - Continued discussion about 3D module. Rostislav from Intel team will transform 3D module evolution proposal and will put it to OpenCV wiki
2. Anna:
   - travelling
3. Gary:
   - Asked Ajit to prepare the final request to expose some internals of Macbeth detector. Here are some results: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/pull/2644.

   - trying to remove some very old pieces of OpenCV (pre 1.0) in the internal codebase.
1. Anna:
   - tested a bunch of PRs this week
   - RISC-V project: finally managed to build RISC-V version of OpenCV and run the tests on QEMU (some unofficial branch of it) with RVV enabled.
   - some patches for OpenCV DNN are coming

   - finishing anniversary site
   - new logo has been created. PR is created. opencv.org/resources/mediakit 
   - new article for OpenCV blog is basically ready, waiting for the review
1. Stefano:
   - the tracking project is going well. The project required some serious refactoring of OpenCV DNN. Instead, the core team did this refactoring. The scope of the project needed some changes. Hopefully, next time during GSoC we will avoid such situation
   - need to refactor ONNX importer (and maybe other) to simplify importing of 3rd-party models
1. Shiqi:
   - text detection & recognition project goes well. The student is now working on improving LSTM inside OpenCV DNN.
   - development partnership is evolving. have 2 partners already, more is coming. Need to publish the program finally.
   - two 3d sensors have been sent to Anna

### *__Minutes__*

1. The first anniversary video can be published on Tuesday. Current version is sent  to Vadim, Satia, Victor for approval.
Anna, Lydia and Gary work on regular video interviews about OpenCV, computer vision in general and related topics. Schedule: weekly or so. The interviews can be interleaved with screencasts or other non-interview formats. + podcasts format
2. Alexander is now working on installing all the necessary software stack (Jenkins-based) to the local master machine and then to worker machines. The primary goal is to test RISC-V build of OpenCV (using RISC-V emulator). Other important targets are ‚Äúalways-enabled‚Äù ARM build, probably Android build. It would be nice to have powerful ARM server, in this case we could use Docker to test Linux-on-ARM and Android-on-ARM much more efficiently.
3. New OpenCV logo has been designed and approved. The site and OpenCV repository will be updated shortly.
4. Vadim:
     * Had some conversations with OpenCV DNN folks. The agreement is to make a series of evolution proposals on how to refactor OpenCV DNN to make it more efficient and more convenient to use.
     * Macbeth color checker detector (GSoC project) has been accelerated by more than 10x. Both traditional vision and deep learning algorithms now work reasonably fast.
     * Experimented with Python modules. The idea is to convert OpenCV Python bindings from a single-file binary-only representation (cv2.so/.pyd) to a directory:

     ```
     cv2/
         cv2_bin{.so|.pyd}
         __init__.py # will contains `from .cv2_bin import *`
         <some more python scripts>
     ``` 		

     * that is, some bits of Python code can be used in the bindings and that will make some API (like FileStorage etc.) more ‚ÄúPythonic‚Äù. The main motivation of this change is to make the code that automatically downloads DNN models a part of OpenCV Python bindings.

* Vadim:
  * Julia bindings: 2nd PR has been submitted
  * RANSAC: 1st PR has been submitted
* Anna:
  * GSoC student has submitted PR on PyTorch/TF+OpenCV tutorial
  * RISC-V GSoC student did not submit PR, but he is doing well
  * xp.ai is working on PRs
  * xp.ai is working on practical aspect of external build farm for h/w partnership program
    * Jenkins will be used as master machine with externally visible IP, and it will talk to build slaves for CI
    * It's under question how it will connect to build slaves in China because of firewall
  * Film raw materials are almost prepared, film preparation is in progress
  * Web site for 20th OpenCV anniversary should be ready by the end of the week
  * Blog post for OpenCV.org is ready and published
* Gary:
  * Macbeth GSoC project PR has been submitted. Gary is now testing it.
  * Current implementation (in C++) is not very fast, ~1fps. Gary's prototype implementation in Python takes ~same time.
  * Hybrid implementation (deep nets + traditional CV for checking pattern) is much faster.
  * Sample can assume that the model is downloaded and put into the current working directory.
* Edgar:
  * Kornia 3.2 is going to be released soon
* Stefano:
  * ONNX smooth import is still not solved problem
* Need to find some hosting for OpenCV models (GSoC results, ...)
  * In general, the problem of using deep-learning based samples/API in OpenCV has 3 sides:
    * Hosting for the models <== need to find good hosting
    * API to download the model and cache it <== need to provide standard API for that (at least for Python, there are some bits of code which we can re-use)
    * Better diagnostic if something goes wrong with the model (it's too complex to be loaded) (need to modify ONNX and other importers in DNN to give better "global" diagnostic)

## 2020-03-18

### *__Minutes__*
* xperience.ai: number of open PRs went down to about 50 and stabilized there. Most of "low-hanging fruit" PR have been closed and in average the open PRs are much newer than before. So it just needs consistent maintenance to keep this number that low.
* PlaidML support in G-API is still very basic, at just concept level.
* In TF add-ons (which are similar in status to "opencv_contrib") there is growing amount of image processing functionality. It's probably going to be expanded further during GSoC 2020. On the other hand, most of this functionality is either using OpenCV or not very efficient.
* The text recognition project in OpenCV GSoC 2020 does not necessarily require biLSTM. Stefano will reply the student question about it.
* The patch with DNN acceleration for ARM has been merged, should be a part of OpenCV 4.3.0. It supports only Linux ARM. The patch with Android support has been submitted and is under review.
* Intel core team updates:
   * OpenCV 4.3.0 should come out on time, i.e. 1st week of April. But OpenVINO release might be delayed by about 2 weeks.
   * Magnetic Lasso algorithm implemented. The PR has been submitted.
   * DiamPRN object tracking network, together with the demo, has been converted to ONNX; DNN has been modified to support it. The corresponding PR is being prepared. The algorithms run at 30FPS on CPU!
   * QR detector is being improved to better detect QR codes in the case of radial distortion. PR is in progress.
   * DynamicFusion implementation is being improved.

#### Release
OpenCV release is coming. This week is soft code freeze stage, the next week -- strong freeze. New features like OpenJPEG support will be merged right after release.

#### Hackathon
Alexander is working on public Hackathon report. Hopefully, it'll be ready till the next call.

#### Process improvements
1. FAQ page on Wiki can be useful for beginners and as a solution for often questions and bug reports. The page should contain question or problem and link to ticket, answers.opencv.org, Stackoverflow or any other page with discussion.
2. It's time to update issue template in code OpenCV repository. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov to work on it. Important ideas:
   - Add checklist with 3 items:
     - I updated to latest OpenCV version -- master branch for 4.x and 3.4 branch for 3.x and the issue is still there.
     - I checked the problem with FAQ, open issues, answers.opencv.org, Stackoverflow, etc...
     - There is reproducer and related data (network for dnn, test images, videos, etc).
   - Extra description should be done with xml/html comments to have short description in ticket.
   - It's possible to use a different template for bugs and features.
   - 3.4 branch is for bugs only. New features should go to master (4.x releases).
3. Ideas for blog at OpenCV.org (Alexander plans to work on tech things, Lydia -- relations with external people):
   - Promote Google Summer of Code topics as blog post with problem statements and related work. Publish GSoC results in the same way.
   - Publish technical notes about OpenCV like usage with different cameras, for different embedded platforms, python and java bindings, etc. The articles can be merged to some documentation page or wiki page.
   - Involve speakers of well known conferences to publish texts on OpenCV.org.
   - it's a good idea to promote blog posts over OpenCV mailing list.

#### PRs discussion
   -  RFC: Jpeg2000 OpenJPEG port (#16494, #16524) -- AI to Alexander Alekhin to list all remaining items. The patch can be merged only after release.
   - Support of Unicode file paths under Windows #13368, related task  #4292, #5631. - It's decided that OpenCV team will not add functions with wchar_t and std::wstring. UTF8 can be used with std::string and standard C/C++ and imdecode/imencode can be used to work with custom symbols. As alternative OpenCV can support C++ iostream API. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov: close the PR, add item to FAQ page and close related tickets and topics with proper description and links. See https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/13368#issuecomment-509225982
   - OpenCV addons #6722 -- closed.
   - Update test_fitellipse.cpp resolving #10270 #16426 -- closed.

#### FFmpeg support
1. OpenCV cannot be compiled with some old versions, even if they are mentioned in the code.
2. @Vadim Levin will collect information about FFMPEG versions in different Linux distributions and user tickets to understand minimal version that should be supported. Current idea for FFmpeg baseline: Ubuntu14.04 or Ubuntu 16.04.
3. It's reasonable to support some old FFmpeg versions for embedded boards that usually do not get OS update.
4. Old FFmpeg versions should be dropped in 3.4 too to resolve further merge conflicts.

**Hackathon**
1. Core team continue work on merge of hackathon PRs the next week. Remaining PRs contain a lot of changes.
2. Hackathon label will be there and the team will add it to tasks for the next Hackathon.
3. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov write article to OpenCV blog on hackathon results.AI to @Alexander Smorkalov collect information about major hackathon contributors.

**PRs discussion**
   - Support audio module [#16578](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16578). Audio support is an experimental feature and the team decided to move development to opencv_contrib. The module support motivation -- simple wav files i/o and basic processing to use with DNN module.
   - Expose maxIters in findFundamentalMat [#16498](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16498) -- useful change. Some API adjustment is required. AI to Alexander & Vadim review and comment.
   - build: OpenCV includes [#12481](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/12481). -- To be closed.
   - Allow access to CUDA pointers for interoperability with other libraries [#16513](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16513) -- .data field of GpuMat should be exposed to Python bindings as read-only property. GPU memory ownership should be documented.

**Algorithm Quality Benchmark**
 * Vadim Pisarevsky works on concept of algorithms quality benchmarking. Major targets: non DNN algos like RANSAC, Hough Transform, pattern detection (chessboard, checkerboard), QR code detection, etc.

**Discussed ideas:**
   - Several images are included into opencv_extra and used as data for unit testing. Major dataset is not included.
   - OpenCV provides some tools & scripting to run benchmark and compute a score. Well known datasets & benchmarks can be used.
   - The benchmark or subset can be added to CI as an optional check,
   - The initial work can be done in the scope of GSoC, internship or academic project.
   - There is a project with relevant scope. https://www.sotabench.com/ runs benchmark for DL models and publish it. https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst/ runs testing without GPU in an efficient way.

## __*Agenda*__
* Considering the [Linux foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/) ... and/or the [Linux AI foundation](https://landscape.lfai.foundation/)
   * Meeting later to(my)day. Want to generate list of questions

### *__Minutes__*

Questions I have, and we should add to

**Background**: OpenCV's goal is to drive/accelerate the beneficial uses of computer vision in society.That's the core mission¬†that I want to freedom to achieve. It goes beyond just a codebase, though it is that too.¬†

* I need a much better understanding of how the funding works for a project under the Linux foundation vs under the Linux AI foundation?
   * In particular, I want funds raised for OpenCV to go to OpenCV and not into a "pool" from which I must then request/justify/argue for allocations. Is this OK?
   * Is that best done under LF or LFAI? Or help me understand better how this works with the understanding that I do not want a gated, or two step allocation process.
* There is an entanglement that needs to be untangled:¬†
   * I formed the Open Source Vision Foundation OSVF which is a 501c3 umbrella for (filed fictitious names):
      * CARLA -- an autonomous driving simulator
      * Open3D -- 3D point cloud processing (such as comes from LIDAR or other depth sensors)
      * OpenCV -- my computer vision
      * Kornia -- differential computer vision. Possibly this might combine in some way with OpenCV TBD
      * OpenSAM -- wants to join, it does SLAM -- creating 3D maps from sensors and using such maps to find and then track where you are to high precision.
   * These other teams can remain (if they desire) under OSVF, or they can be folded into the LF or LFAI under whatever terms each sub-group can agree on. They each have independent technical¬†teams and it would be up to them ... I didn't choose these randomly, they are all top tier quality.
* Subject to all the above, I really want to understand how OpenCV under LF.org would work.¬†
   * We raise $N. What part does the LF take or LFAI take?¬†
   * What resources are at OpenCV's disposal¬†
      * Legal questions?¬†
      * Accountants?¬†
      * PR?
      * ...
   * Many big company names give $s to the LF or LFAI it seems. Does that compete with say, getting Microsoft to donate directly to OpenCV? Or is that some pool which OpenCV could access? How does this work?
* Legal attacks:
   * Let's say someone asserts a trademark, or a patent, or some lawsuit against OpenCV. Does the LF take up the fight?¬†
   * Let's say under whatever theory, this someone goes after me personally as a founder/director/whatever of OpenCV. 
      * My problem? 
      * Or LF (a) defends me? (b) indemnifies me?
   * Compliance with or dealing with possible US gov interference in the project, for example in the future imposing AI code restrictions etc.
* I have a lot of questions about my freedom of action under LF as to running OpenCV
   * I'm paying a developer and part of a developer's manager's time to a consulting group. That consulting group offers the developer's and manager's time at cost. My first priority is expanding this group to a minimum of 3 developers, but really targetting having many more: 10 or even more depending on funding. 
      * These contractors are provided at cost to OpenCV (substantially below market).
   * Similar for interns. Every year, OpenCV enters Google's Summer of Code ... I want to run OpenCV's Summer of Code.
   * I'd like the option to directly support research. That is, I have many academic contacts and want the freedom of action, should a topic/research and willing professor be found that I could support that student to fill some gap resulting in a contribution of that algorithm/code into OpenCV.¬†
   * When financially able, I'd like to be able to afford a full-time admin that would take care of the million things that barely get done now or dropped by me to free me up to focus on driving the library's direction.
   * Right now, I run this out of my house, borrowed conference rooms and coffee shops. If finances allow, I want to have an office (the official address is really my accountant's office right now).
   * I and others will attend academic conferences, propose workshops, run tutorials, staff booths etc at existing conferences and tradeshows. This may induce travel, room, conference and other expenses.
   * We may sponsor contests, hackathons, host datasets, collect or create datasets for these functions or to advance the field.
   * I'm fine with attending, participating, giving tutorials etc in LF conferences or events, but I want the freedom, if we choose, to host our own conference, workshop or events.
   * I want to be able to keep mailing lists of people who sign up.
   * I'd like to create a "Open and Free Contributory license". That is, for people using the library for commercial purposes, this would be a voluntary nominal annual payment (for example, $20 or whatever amount desired) per head. This would clearly state this is not required and in no way enforced but is merely a voluntary contribution to give back to the library.
   * **Any problem with any of the above?**
* Website
   * Without a lot of flack or delay, we want to control OpenCV's website (wherever it clicks through from the LF site) and of course, github repository + wiki. Put up a blog, A/B test donation buttons, host or point to content in accordance with OpenCV's mission. If a member of LF, I don't mind it being within a LF frame/logo etc. Problems? Procedures?
* Revenue w/in mission
   * Books, whether written by OpenCV or not, directly sold or click through. These would be certified -- that is, we think they are of sufficient quality in important areas for people's understanding of computer vision or issues related to it.
   * Camera, Smart Camera, chips/board HW. Similar to the above. We'd certify hardware of high quality and give an honest assessment of important issues (outdoor/indoor/waterproof, frame rate, power, accuracy etc) and in turn, we'd get a membership fee and click through share of sales.
   * We are toying with offering Kickstarters for features. Basically, users vote with their money for features they want to be developed. If the money raised is sufficient to develop that feature, we do it, else the money is returned.¬†
   * Courseware. We already have professional courseware that contributes 20% to the library. The courseware is  of very high quality and so OpenCV links to it in return for 20%
* Foreign operation
   * Especially China? Developers there, how to work with?
* Contacts
   * I want to talk to some existing projects.
* OpenCV Brand management inside LF or LFAI?
* General specific donation? For example, can we put up a donate button that goes to OpenCV specifically?
* If we are funded through the LF or LFAI
* If things don't work out, extracting OpenCV from LF or LFAI: Can we and how do we do that (decision process)?
   * If we want to hedge, can we keep a foundation "home" externally but mainly run internally with the "home" just a "escape path" for the above.
* Trademark? We don't have? Can we or should we attempt to get? What if someone tries to "trump" our trademark?
   * Defense against transfer and then attacks that we don't want.
* OpenCV structure is complex
   * LearnOpenCV
   * Intel team ... OpenVino team
   * China team OpenCV.cn
   * Can other sites live separately?
* Other vision projects ... cannibalization of code or competition by other ops w/in LF or LFAI?
   * Where is the place where we provide technical decisions of what is in or out of the code
   * Only pull requests ... if contribution, what control over that? Intel uses graph API for example, then pulls or changes it w/o any control/consultation?
   * Where do we decide roadmap? OpenCL

* Roadmap
   * [OpenCV Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals)
   * Develop evolution proposals
      * We can devote occasional meetings to this

* I'm forming a contracting consulting company, **OpenCV.ai**, in AI broadly and Computer Vision in particular whose moral intent it is to contribute some % of profits to OpenCV.org. It could be made a nominal subsidiary or partner of OpenCV.org if any of the above must be instead hosted on a for-profit site.



* Hackathon:

1. Lydia joined Xperience AI team in role of program manager. Welcome Lydia!
2. Hackathon is in progress. The most important contribution is OpenJPEG library integration for JPEG200 support (#16494, #16524). Core team will work on PR review and merge for the next week. Will discuss final status next time.
3. PR & Tickets handling process: PR template implemented and merged. The next steps are:
   - answers.opencv.org resurrection. Stackoverflow is possible alternative. The major goal is to attract community and resolve basic questions there instead of issue tracker. Xperience AI team will try to restart community there.
   - "Good First Issue" label for easy to implement tickets to attract students and newcomers.
4. @Vadim Pisarevsky found good dataset for HoughCircles algorithm testing and rewrote some pieces. It's a good idea to assess some functions and algorithms with public datasets and publish/track score. Possible subjects are: QR codes, chess boards and other calibration patterns, RANSAC. To be discussed on the next meetings in details. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov and @Vadim Pisarevsky prepare an agenda for the next meeting.
5. PRs discussion:
   - core: CV_STRONG_ALIGNMENT macro #16463 - the solution requires extra job on CI. AI to @Alekhin, Alexander add extra job to CI and merge the patch.
   - cmake: split opencv_modules.hpp #12549 - to be merged.
   - Fix bugs in arithm_op() for InputArray (src == dst) case #13570 - to be closed. The patch tries to add fake inplace processing support to functions that are not designed for it. Extra memory allocation and copies are not reasonable for most cases. AI to @Vadim Pisarevsky to close the PR with justification.

* Update

### *__Minutes__*
* 

#### Updates 

1. OpenCV team submitted all required papers for Google Summer of Code.
2. Hackathon announcement is published, the team is ready. Alexander Alekhin will work on PRs review. AI to @Vadim Pisarevsky to add QA part to Google Group.
3. PR template from Alexander looks good enough. There are some comments in PR. AI to @Vadim Pisarevsky: propose legal wording about license. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov to move all links, details and recommendations to the "How To Contribute" page and add single link to PR template.
4. Initial work on profiles for  cv::VideoWriter support is done. Prepared codec parameters, implemented script for their optimization. Implementation will be submitted right after refactoring.
5. PRs & tickets discussion:
   - Enable 2-channel arrays in resize tests ([PR #16189](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16189)) -- the tests open several bugs in current implementation. AI for @Alekhin, Alexander list all remaining items in PR to do it during the hackathon.
   - Python module: replace config.py files by config.ini ([PR #16008](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16008)). Config.py contains logic to load proper modules for Intel Python, Conda, etc and it cannot be replaced by a plain config file. The expected behavior can be achieved with CMake options. The PR is closed.
   - add REDUCE_SUM2 ([PR #13879](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/13879)). Proposed for the Hackathon. Remaining items: disable sanity checks for new test cases and squash commits for merge.
   - VideoIO classes refactoring ([PR #16242](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16246)). Vadim will finish until the next meeting.
   - Fix issue [#6450 (ios) (PR #Fix issue #6450 (ios) (PR #15464)15464)](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/15464). The patch is useful AI to @Vadim Pisarevsky to fix warning and merge the patch during the hackathon.
   - Issue [#13602](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/13602) GaussianBlur does not support border type wrap. WRAP mode implementation does not make sense, documentation update only. Added to hackathon scope.
   - Issue [#15499](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/15499) CAP_PROP_FRAME_WIDTH/HEIGHT swapped. The actual issue reason is metadata in videos. Renamed the ticket to describe the issue properly and added the next steps there. Added to the Hackathon scope.
   - Issue [#9392](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/9392) Reference to non-existent parameter name in the documentation of StereoSGBM::create (Still needs the decision). Renaming and documentation update is required. Alexander listed all remaining items on the ticket.

## __*Agenda*__
* Browser
* GSoC
* Updates

### *__Minutes__*
* Browser -- the below can help make vision integral to browsers that we may engage with
   * Talk with Mozilla about this (GSoC project? Probably too involved or complex)
      * WebGPU (working group inside W3C), 
      * WebAssembly (expand WebAssembly outside of the browser, Byte code alliance, WASI standard -- extensions) 
      * WebSIMD (in progress, efforts happening, but few people. Extraction layer over SIMD, threading, long vector instruction)
      * Compiler for optimization/vision OpenNP, LLDM (GSoC) ... but looks maybe too big for a student
* GSoC
   * Application is already complete
   * [Ideas list](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2020#opencv-project-ideas-list)
      * Now 15 ideas, the application is complete
      * Adding Tensor flow connection idea
      * OpenNP lldm ... use compiler to optimize vision in browser
         * But probably too complex for a student project
   * We have strong people for overhauling RANSAC. OpenCV foundation may extend student support for this beyond GSoC
* China team
   * Paused by Chinese new year and Coronavirus
   * Collaborating with some startup in China to accelerate OpenCV DNN for ARM. Very promising results. The patch will hopefully be ready and integrated by OpenCV 5 or even earlier.
   * Looking for extra engineers ... again delayed
   * HW for build factory ... also delayed
   * Shiqi ... discussing adapting courseware to Chinese. Not delayed since can be done at home
* Kickstarter for features or toolboxes
   * We should come up with a list we can try this
* Hackathon
   * Feb 2nd
   * Set up a "thankyou" page, and post hackathon thanks
   * Can send now to mailing list and blog list

* **Update**
   * RISC-V close to RISC pipe committee (they may be the mentors for the idea)
   * Down to 62 pull requests, now more new than old pull requests
      * Probably need to track the average age of pull requests soon
   * Make sure every pull requests is attended to
      * Make a formal process for the response -- what's wrong, what to do if abandoned by the contributor
      * Looking into other projects, how they do it: finding -- no formal processes. Linux is just by fiat by the main guy
         * We want aliveness response
         * Check that it's 3.4 or later
   * What should be done for a pull requests
   * Preparing for hackathon, can provide list

1. Vadim Pisarevsky could not join today. The first and second agenda items were skipped.
2. Hackathon announcement has been published on [opencv.org](http://opencv.org/). Thanks, Satya for post promotion.
3. PR handling process was discussed with Alexander Alekhin. Major items:
   - Stale bot produces to many spam e-mails for maintainer, very detailed configuration is required. The idea is postponed.
   - 2 weeks is too short to wait for PR author, e.g. maintainer or author vacations.
   - We can add a checklist and links to test examples directly to the PR template. It's a useful solution and works as a reminder. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov proposes an alternative PR template.
   - Proposed new tag "Discussion Required" for PRs. All PRs with the tag are discussed by the core team before actual review and integration. The tag is designed for PRs with suspicious changes, PRs with small value and changes that breaks existing logic or API. AI to @Alexander Smorkalov introduce the tag on Github and add notes to the Contribution guide.
4. PRs discussion status:
   - optimize cvCeil and cvFloor in fase_math.hpp #16160 -- closed as incomplete; no author replies on questions.
   - core: Workaround flip horiz [#16152](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/16152) -- the PR highlights memory alignment issue on ARM v7 for vectorized code. The PR cannot be merged as-is. AI to @Alekhin, Alexander to file a ticket with a detailed description, propose an alternative solution and then close the original PR.
   - Add package for CMake project #16322 -- The patch rejected as we do not maintain it and most of package management systems store metafiles and extra patches on their side.
   - Fix bugs in arithm_op() for InputArray (src == dst) case. #13570 -- To be discussed with Vadim Pisarevsky.
   - export IMG decoders/encoders #8511 -- To be discussed with Vadim Pisarevsky.

## __*Agenda*__
*

### *__Minutes__*

My notes from the meeting today:
1. The team agreed  WW06 (Feb 2-9) as a preliminary timeframe for OpenCV Hackathon. @A lexander S morkalov  and @V adim L evin will create short list of tickets for the hackathon for the next meeting.
2. V adim L evin has done serious cv::VideoCapture refactoring that breaks compatibility. AI to @A lekhin, A lexander and @V adim P isarevsky to review PR to discuss the solution on the next meeting.
3. Most of fixes from V adim L evin for Python bindings have been merged. @V adim L evin will split remaining PR on 2: existing bug fixes and new functionality. The second one will be discussed later.
4. Abandoned PRs:
- BFGS and L-BFGS optimization methods: AI to @A lexander S morkalov  to close. The implementation is buggy.
- Clang format: AI to @A lekhin, A lexander to close the PR with comments. The formatter introduces a lot of changes in code and some of them are not well readable.
- Objdetect module const correctness: AI to @A lekhin, Alexander to close the PR and related ticket with resolution "will not fix". Some object detectors are not constant by design and not thread safe. We can force detectors interface and overcome mutability problem with thread local variables and other C++ hacks, but it introduces non-obvious behavior.
5. OpenCV 5.0 is planned for release in June-July time frame. The release is aligned to 20th anniversary of the project.
6. A lexander S morkalov started document to collect common replies to PRs: AI to @A lekhin, A lexander  to join and extend the document.
