h2. How you will be evaluated if you are an accepted student

* Student projects to be paid only if:
** *Midterm:*
*** You must generate a pull request
**** That builds
**** Has at least stubbed out functionality
**** With appropriate Doxygen documentation
**** Has at least stubbed out unit test
**** Has a stubbed out example of use that builds
** *End of summer:*
*** A full pull request
**** Full Doxygen documentation
**** A good unit test
**** Example of use code
*** Create a (short!) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your code
**** We use this to create an overall summary. Past years:
***** "The 2015 Movie":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s
***** "The 2014 Movie":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA
***** "The 2013 Movie":https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA

h2. For students interested in applying

# You *must* already know how to program fluently in C++
** Some projects may require Python or Matlab skills
# Ask to join the "OpenCV GSoC Forum List":https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017
** Discuss projects below or other ideas with us there between now and March
# In March, Go to the "GSoC site":https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ and sign up to be a student with OpenCV
# Post the project from below or your own agreed on project on the GSoC to opencv-gsoc-2017@googlegroups.com
** Include Name, google email, age
** Include how you think you are qualified to accomplish this project (skills, courses, relevant background)
** Include Country of origin, school you are enrolled in, Professor you work with (if any)
** Include a projected timeline and milestones for the project
# Once (and if!) OpenCV gets accepted as GSoC org this year, and we are told how many slots we will get *and* you've signed up for a project with us in March
** We will weigh the students and projects against the mentors we gather and the mentor's interests and choose which students/project to pursue.
** Accepted students will be posted on the GSoC site in May (and we will notify the accepted students ourselves).

h2. For computer vision professionals interested in mentoring

# Go to the "GSoC site":https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ and sign up.
# Request to be a mentor for OpenCV there.
# We accept or reject you
# Students submit projects and you
** find a project you want to mentor (several students might try for the same project)
** contact us about it through opencv-gsoc-2017@googlegroups.com so we can be sure there is not someone already handling that project
** contact the students to assess which one if any are capable of coding that up in a summer.
# We get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators then _"spend"_ the slots in order of priority
# Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
** Sheesh!

*If* you are accepted as a mentor *and* you find a suitable student *and* we give you a slot *and* the student signs up for it, +*then*+ you are a mentor.
** It sounds harder than it is.

h1. 2017 Project Ideas:

* Students may propose their own projects (give us a clear summary and why you can do this project). However, below are some of our priorities for this year
* Contact us and/or discuss ideas at [[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017]]

_These are *not* in order of priority_

*1. Tutorials*
* We have so much good code in "opencv_contrib":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib that needs better documentation, tutorials, examples of use etc. Particularly:
** Our deep net library, "tiny-dnn":https://github.com/tiny-dnn/ needs examples of how to 
*** Setup, build and run on various OS
*** Training
*** Testing
*** Running on mobile
** DNN -- examples of running models learned in Caffe and Torch. Speed tests
** Go over and update/improve/expand on existing tutorials
** Computational Photography
** Tracking
** Camera Calibration
** Video stabilization
** Image stitching

*2a. Deep learning*
* OpenCV works with/has an entire deep net library, "tiny-dnn":https://github.com/tiny-dnn/
** There are plenty of development tasks that we want done
*** In particular, we'd like to learn *compact* (that can be fit on mobile) models ("see SqueezeNet":https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet for inspiration that recognize:
*** People
*** Cars
*** Animals, particularly dogs and cats outside and inside.
*** Face and/or face features
*** Text
*** Floors, Walls, Ceilings, Windows, Doors, Tables, Chairs
*** Others....

*2b. Running deep learning*
* OpenCV also has DNN, that runs models learned from Tensor flow or Caffe. Love to extend to torch or other tasks

*3. Google Cardboard*
* Do visual odometry, SLAM, tracking etc for Google Cardboard as an OpenCV Android app. Partly this is tutorial -- show others how to do it.

*4. True, robust checkerboard out of "April Tags":http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/ or "Aruco Tags":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco*
* The code for detecting "Aruco and Charuco":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco tags needs improvement.

*5. Working, well done SLAM*
* We have tried to get in reliable building blocks for SLAM for years. We've made some projects, but it's not there yet.
* Please don't even think about doing this project unless you are already doing SLAM in your advanced PhD work. This is a hard algorithm to get right and you just won't unless you are already a leading expert!

*6. Improve background subtraction*
* We have a Mixture of Guassian *(MoG)* fitting algorithms that work well, but they fail to take into consideration the variation or effects from nearby pixels. Find a better way. We can suggest approaches. 
* Extra credit if it can work with a moving camera in a known scene. 

*7. Improve the video stabilization module*
* It works well now. Maybe just improve the tutorial, but try to improve the algorithm.
* Try to add deep methods.

*8. Saliency model*
* Improve the saliency relevance
* Improve the application interface (API).

*9. Text detection*
* Improve the text detection module
** Test/improve on other datasets

*10. Improve data labeling*
* Write better primitives for marking, segmenting, storing image (and possibly 3D!) data
* But maybe just work with and improve the VATIC code (contact authors?)
** https://github.com/cvondrick/vatic
** http://web.mit.edu/vondrick/vatic/

*11 OpenCV for interaction*
* Hand or finger detection
* gesture recognition
* human skeleton based on 2d or 3d

*12. Color Calibration and white balance*
* With McBeth chart and with gray world algorithm (improve exisiting color constancy algorithms)
* Possibly collect deep learning way of doing this (needs large training set)

*13. Improve text recognition accuracy in opencv_contrib/text module.*
* It would be interesting to adapt the module to use one of the several Deep CNN models have been made public during the last year (both for character and word recognition) e.g.[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/text/]. Any other further improvement of the module is also welcome.
