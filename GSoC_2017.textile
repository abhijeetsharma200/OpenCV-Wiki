h2. For students interested in applying

# You *must* already know how to program fluently in C++
** Some projects may require Python or Matlab skills
# Ask to join the "OpenCV GSoC Forum List":https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017
** Discuss projects below or other ideas with us there between now and March
# In March, Go to the "GSoC site":https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ and sign up to be a student with OpenCV
# Post the project from below or your own agreed on project on the GSoC to opencv-gsoc-2017@googlegroups.com
** Include Name, google email, age
** Include how you think you are qualified to accomplish this project (skills, courses, relevant background)
** Include Country of origin, school you are enrolled in, Professor you work with (if any)
** Include a projected timeline and milestones for the project
# Once (and if!) OpenCV gets accepted as GSoC org this year, and we are told how many slots we will get *and* you've signed up for a project with us in March
** We will weigh the students and projects against the mentors we gather and the mentor's interests and choose which students/project to pursue.
** Accepted students will be posted on the GSoC site in May (and we will notify the accepted students ourselves).

h2. For computer vision professionals interested in mentoring

# Go to the "GSoC site":https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/ and sign up.
# Request to be a mentor for OpenCV there.
# We accept or reject you
# Students submit projects and you
** find a project you want to mentor (several students might try for the same project)
** contact us about it through opencv-gsoc-2017@googlegroups.com so we can be sure there is not someone already handling that project
** contact the students to assess which one if any are capable of coding that up in a summer.
# We get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators then _"spend"_ the slots in order of priority
# Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
** Sheesh!

*If* you are accepted as a mentor *and* you find a suitable student *and* we give you a slot *and* the student signs up for it, +*then*+ you are a mentor.
** It sounds harder than it is.

h1. 2017 Project Ideas:

* Students may propose their own projects (give us a clear summary and why you can do this project). However, below are some of our priorities for this year
* Contact us and/or discuss ideas at [[https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017]]

_These are *not* in order of priority_

*1. Tutorials*
* We have so much good code in "opencv_contrib":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib that needs better documentation, tutorials, examples of use etc. Particularly:
** Our deep net library, "tiny-dnn":https://github.com/tiny-dnn/ needs examples of how to 
*** Setup, build and run on various OS
*** Training
*** Testing
*** Running on mobile
** DNN -- examples of running models learned in Caffe and Torch. Speed tests
** Go over and update/improve/expand on existing tutorials
** Computational Photography
** Tracking
** Camera Calibration
** Video stabilization
** Image stitching

*2a. Deep learning. Improving OpenCV Deep learning functionality*
* OpenCV works with/has an entire deep net library, "tiny-dnn":https://github.com/tiny-dnn/. Or, there is implemented from scratch "DNN module":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/dnn. You are welcome to base your proposal on any of these 2 options. We want better performance, more tests, tutorials, python/java wrappers etc.

*2b. Deep learning. Compact models.*
* We'd like to learn *compact* (that can be fit on mobile, i.e. models that take a few megabytes of disk or memory space) models ("see SqueezeNet":https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet for inspiration that recognize:
*** People
*** Cars
*** Animals, particularly dogs and cats outside and inside.
*** Face and/or face features
*** Text
*** Floors, Walls, Ceilings, Windows, Doors, Tables, Chairs
*** Others....

*3. True, robust checkerboard out of "April Tags":http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/ or "Aruco Tags":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco*
* The code for detecting "Aruco and Charuco":https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco tags needs improvement.

*4. Working, well-done SLAM*
* We have tried to get in reliable building blocks for SLAM for years. We've made some projects, but it's not there yet.
* Please don't even think about doing this project unless you are already doing SLAM in your advanced PhD work. This is a hard algorithm to get right and you just won't unless you are already a leading expert!

*5. Improve background subtraction*
* We have a Mixture of Guassian *(MoG)* fitting algorithms that work well, but they fail to take into consideration the correlation between neighbour pixels. Find a better way. We can suggest approaches. 
* Extra credit if it can detect or even compensate for camera motion. 

*6. Improve the video stabilization module*
* It works well now. Maybe just improve the tutorial, but try to improve the algorithm.
* Try to add deep methods.

*7. Saliency model*
* Improve the saliency relevance
* Improve the application interface (API).

*8. Text detection*
* Improve the text detection module
** Test/improve on other datasets

*9. Improve data labeling*
* Write better primitives for marking, segmenting, storing image (and possibly 3D!) data
* But maybe just work with and improve the VATIC code (contact authors?)
** https://github.com/cvondrick/vatic
** http://web.mit.edu/vondrick/vatic/

*10. OpenCV for interaction*
* Hand or finger detection
* gesture recognition
* human skeleton based on 2d or 3d

*11. Improve text recognition speed and accuracy in opencv_contrib/text module.*
* It would be interesting to adapt the module to use one of the several Deep CNN models have been made public during the last year (both for character and word recognition) e.g.[http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/text/]. Any other further improvement of the module is also welcome. Last year a DNN has been built that recognizes characters, but it's huge. We are interested in a very compact network (a few megabytes, may be up to 20Mb or so) for character recognition.

*12. Extend translation of OpenCV into Java script. OpenCV.js*
* OpenCV.js  OpenCV in javascript. Looks very interesting, has huge scale to run vision inside a browser
** [[https://github.com/ucisysarch]]
** Examples
*** [[http://ucisysarch.github.io/opencvjs/examples/img_proc.html]]
*** [[http://ucisysarch.github.io/opencvjs/examples/face_detect.html]]

*13. Improve 3D visualization for vis*
* The "vis module":https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/viz is very useful, but it needs:
** Easy way to directly enter cv::Mat containing depth or disparity into a point cloud for vis
** Point cloud to ply converter
** Once in vis, automatic color coded surface normal visualization "see here":http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Visualization/ElevationBandsWithGlyphs
*** And "also here":http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Points/NormalEstimation
** Tutorials showing how to use its features
*** Add "onto here":http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/viz/table_of_content_viz/table_of_content_viz.html


*14. Optimizing various stuff*
* This is very general and always relevant topic. OpenCV is known for decent speed, but there is always room for improvement, especially in the experimental part (opencv_contrib). You are welcome to come up with concrete proposals on optimizing a particular functionality. Optimisation can be done using OpenCL, parallelisation, SSE/AVX or "universal intrinsics":https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/hal. It can also be "algorithmic" optimization, which, despite its name, means that the algorithm basically stays the same, but you find some ways to eliminate some unnecessary computations, unnecessary memory allocations etc.
* For example, we would be interested in optimizing image processing (imgproc, opencv_contrib/ximgproc), text detection (opencv_contrib/text), TLD tracker (opencv_contrib/tracking), computational photography (photo and opencv_contrib/xphoto), dnn module (opencv_contrib/dnn), feature detectors (features2d and opencv_contrib/xfeatures2d), non-dnn-based object detection (opencv_contrib/dpm and opencv_contrib/xobjdetect). You are welcome to propose for optimization some other functionality, though.

*15. ROI algebra, improving mask creation and manipulation*
* Algebra on ROI-s implementing union, intersection, exclusion and more. Have to handle  contours, rectangles and circles at least. Proposals are expected to expand on this abstract, come up with a fixed set of methods, be rich enough to justify for a full summer's work and demonstrate their usefulness with examples.
