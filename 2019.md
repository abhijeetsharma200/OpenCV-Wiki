## __*Agenda*__
* GSoC Final period

### *__Minutes__*
* GSoC grading period is Aug 19-26
   * Must send out notice to get reviews in
* DNN via ONNX is hard
   * No way of knowing how hard porting a model is
       * Landmarks, segmentation
      * Classification, segmentation, landmarks, validate and high level API
   * Missing many ops for conversion-driven by specific models
   * Could piggyback on another runtime
      * Inference only
      * Compositional heads to fine-tune on different tasks only?
      * Hyperparameter only search given data automl on google does something like this
   * Or go through tensor flow only
   * OpenVino has a separate repository
      * OpenVino would be OK, but ignoring other GPUs is limiting
   * Impacting deep learning-based facial landmark detector, but he got the other parts done
* DNN is crucial to OpenCV going forward if it is not to become just a pre and post processor
   * Can we make it ONNX compliant?
   * If we can get a seasoned developer(s) it would help
   * **TO DO**
      * Set up meeting with
         * Vladimir Dudnik; Alexander Alekhim
      * Get our own developers by raising money
   * Trademark OpenCV
* Mail by Steven Putterman
   * Where to put data
   * Create data drive OpenCV.org website ... get all the data
* Final GSoC goals
   * completed pull requests
      * Monolithic pull requests ðŸ™€
   * unit tests
      * Code must pass the tests
   * documentation
   * movies

## __*Agenda*__
* New OpenCV release
* Strategy DNN
* GSoC

### *__Minutes__*
* New OpenCV release this week or next
* DNN
   * Need active model zoo
   * Need to make sure that all the layers are in DNN
   * Support ONNX completely
      * What version of ONNX? 4, 5
      * With Diego layer coverage is done by cherry picking of models
         * Missing layers, datatypes
      * Importer based on the cherrypicking 
         * When you take the model, you only see the first error
         * Would rather see all the list of missing layers
         * There is a list of supported layers
      * What is the roadmap for ONNX? 
      * Issues in porting a model
         * Missing in importer
         * Some datatypes not supported
         * Missing parameter configurations
         * Example
            * MDN layer was in DNN but not in importer
            * Alternate implementation -- different issues, loop unrolling
   * Evolved by model cherry picking
   * NVidia inference engine in github already embedded in the tensorflow option
      * Open sourced on github (CUDA) tensor RT stuff
      * Parse over the graph -- ONNX inference
   * Microsoft ONNX inference is useful to look at CNPK (deprecated). Going instead at [ONNX runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime)
* GSoC
   * Need to get weekly reports 
   * Updates for the [OpenCV projects](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019#opencv-accepted-projects)
      * Facelandmarks  none were trainable
          * Trainable models now
          * No python bindings, now have them (sent and approved pull requests)
          * API 2 disjoint inheritances, now united
          * Wasn't training code, now is
          * The work of 3 people done by one
          * 3D landmark detection paper (2D inferring 3D)
      * Curating Deep Nets for the OpenCV DNN Module
          * Semantic seg, landmarks, mask-RCNN (instance segmentation? Ask Dimitry)
   * 2nd GSoC evaluations July 22, see [GSoC timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/dashboard/timeline/)
* Kornica
   * Adam optimization from pytorch
* Courseware (Aug and Oct) 
   * 1.4K people (don't have to join immediately) -- closed enrollment temporarily for roll out
   * Only need working knowledge of python
   * 3 planned courses
      * Then Next set will be decided
   * Companies are buying course bundles
      * Can others offer mentoring

## 2019-03-20

## __*Agenda*__
* GSoC
* Google Summer of Docs
* Chips
* Python

### *__Minutes__*
* GSoC
   * look into gooogle summer of docs. 
   * Get mentors going on sorting through students.
      * 165 applications to opencv from our site
      * 447 Students on our student list. Need to sort down
   * Students need to come up with their actual plan. Mentors need to find and refine
   * Already people on (sample)
      * Facial landmark focus (Satya)
      * Alpha matting (Sunita)
         * Non deep grabcut, alpha matting
      * DNN GPU (Davis King) Justin
* GSoDocs
   * Here is the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline)
      * Application is due April 2nd
* Embedded chips. OpenCV should work with
   * Jetson nano
   * TPU
   * Intel
   * Other? Huawei? Smart cameras?
* Python is very important to opencv/vision (OpenCV python wrapper is getting 1M downloads per week!)
   * If you look at the OpenCV docs, for [example here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html), it looks all C++
      * Only when you click to the actual function, for example [getPerspectiveTransform](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html#gae66ba39ba2e47dd0750555c7e986ab85) do you see, below the C++ interface is the python interface `Python:
retval	=	cv.getPerspectiveTransform(	src, dst[, solveMethod]	)
`
   * Possibly we can use Google summer of docs to bring out the python interface more

### *__To Dos__*
* Gary
  - [x] Email mentors to look at [application list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RyxEcXI5DaCNU1UZ13jtPso8KDzHx8OPM6vudXxt6to) and get back to mentors

  - [ ] Get in workshop outline
  - [x] Bank information
  - [ ] Contact Open3D about a possible project
  - [ ] Define a "SLAM"ish task.

* Satya
  - [x] Look into Google summer of Docs how it might be useful for OpenCV

   * Think about a larger calibration/3D framework ... I like [openMVG](http://imagine.enpc.fr/~moulonp/openMVG/coreFeatures.html), but I'm thinking more of a sort of "SLAM Toolbox" for robotics.
   * Open up a project for better interworking with [Open3D](http://www.open3d.org). Gary to ask
   * Get in final projects on [ideas list](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019#opencv-project-ideas-list) and announce them to [the group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2019)

   * Priorities:
      * GPU backend for DNN -- very necessary that this is a complete package
      * Place to get curated DNN models especially for face, body, hands -- anything human
         * I would priortize binary models too, but that will depend on Michael's theoretical/mathematical guidence ... and luck of finding the right student
   * Look into LFS on Git for storage of deepnets
   * Create a formal post
      * Post to Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn

### *__To Dos__*
* All
  - [^] Contact Professors and Students
  - [^] Send out formal posting from Satya
* Gary
  - [^] Post to Reddit, Twitter, LinkedIn
* Satya
  - [^] Create a formal post for posting, send to others to vet, and then see all above

## 2019-01-30

## __*Agenda*__
* Fill out [GSoC ideas list](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019) in the proper format

### *__Minutes__*
* GSoC Ideas List
   * Can draw from the [OpenCV Evolution Page](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals)
* Python wrapper stays universal
* Satya posted list, will post to site
* Highest priority is Cuda backend for DNN
   * U of S Calif
* SFM continuation
* Contact Professors
* Data augmentation
   * Should run efficiently on GPU ... OpenGL
   * Minimal OpenGL engine (?)
      * But look at NVidia's render https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsLDyiONV4
   * [Neural Render](https://github.com/daniilidis-group/neural_renderer)

### Template for ideas list
1. ### <Descriptive Title such as "Deep Nets">
   1. #### <Descriptive Title>
      * ***Description:*** 3-7 sentences describing the task
      * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
         * < Short bullet list describing what is to be accomplished >
         * <i.e. create a new module called "bla bla">
         * < Has method to accomplish X >
         * <...>
         * Resources
            * [For example a paper citation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08091.pdf)
            * [For example an existing feature request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/11013)
            * [Possibly an existing related module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/optflow) that includes some new optical flow algorithms.
      * ***Skills Required:*** < for example: mastery plus experience coding in C++, college course work in vision that covers optical flow, python. Best if you have also worked with deep neural networks. >
      * ***Mentors:*** < your name goes here >
      * ***Difficulty:*** <Easy, Medium, Hard>
