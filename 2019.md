## __*Agenda*__
*

### *__Minutes__*
* Alexander Smorkalov is employed by OpenCV.org as full time pull request master for user contributions

Meeting minutes:
1. OpenCV release is on track, will be published in 2 weeks.
2. Vadim Levin implemented script to generate report with PR statistics. Complete report is attached. Current version of the report is attached. The team concluded that the report is useful and we will publish it with Github Pages. AI to @Vadim Levin make experimental page with his own Github account. Alexander Alekhin can move it to opencv_infrastructure, when ready. Current decision is to generate and update the page with regular cadence, e.g. daily with CRON/CI. Vadim and Alexander Smorkalov will work on it.
3. Intel team looks on interactive pages with JS to generate the page and media on the go. Dmitry Kurtaev makes experiments on it.
4. Python 2  branch -- end of Life. Python community stops 2.x branch support. OpenCV team decided to continue 2.x support till dependencies and bindings work properly. The major dependency and indicator is numpy.

## __*Agenda*__
* ATOM Tracker
* Plannar patterns
* Update

### *__Minutes__*
* ATOM Tracker
   * One of the best and very efficient trackers, [ATOM](https://github.com/visionml/pytracking) is going to be contributed to OpenCV!
   * Martin Danelljan and Goutam Bhat, 
* Plannar patterns
   * Asift https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/python/asift.py
   * Dmytro Mishkin has git hub repsoitory (on Kornia paper)
       * http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~mishkdmy/
       * Github: https://github.com/ducha-aiki
   * Note that sift patent is expiring 2020-03-06
      * https://patents.google.com/patent/US6711293
* Webp OpenCV does support the format
   * https://developers.google.com/speed/webp

> I am very happy to inform that WebP support is added to OpenCV image
> processing library. Now WebP images can be read / written and
> processed using OpenCV library.

> Please see links
> 1. https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/tree/master/modules/highgui/src
> 2. https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/610
> 3. https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/539
> 4. https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/pull/463

> Glad I have made a small contribution from my part to WebP project.

* Update
1. Release preparation is on track. Release is targeted to the end of the year.
2. Global library re-work enhancement ideas are tracked on wiki page: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals
3. Vadim Levin: Python bindings generator test and related fixes are in progress.Vadim L and Alexander A discuss details in PRs. Strict checks -- good idea. Unusual conversions like bool -> float should be prohibited.
4. Vadim Levin implemented initial script to generate infographics about open PRs distribution to understand where we are. The script is implemented with Python and Github API. The next step is to do it daily and publish on web, e.g. Github pages.
5. Half of open PRs do not have labels. Alexander Alekhin set labels for them after merge to collect information about implemented/fixed things for release changelog. Vadim uses labels like "need rebase", "need test" for statistics script and Xperience.AI team will set it more carefully.
6. Vadim Levin started work on extra constructor for cv::VideoWriter. The constructor contains array of key-value pairs for optional parameters. The first parameter covered by new implementation -- video bitrate.
7. Vadim Pisarevsky will travel next week and most probably cannot join the call.

## 2019-11-13

## __*Agenda*__
* Web access
* Deepnet considerations
* Kickstarter

### *__Minutes__*
* Give more people access to the web sites
* Set up toolboxes that are for profit
   * Problems with maintenance
* OpenVino
   * Inference engine. Supports all Intel. Needs to run all if it is going to "win"
      * OpenCV trademark name
   * OpenCV inference engine DNN on CPU, but needs GPU
      * Need scalable inference
      * Pull requests many engines with many backends. Intel pushing on running PyTorch and TF
         * DNN, not a conversion, but some work. 
      * Work with ONNX MS agnostic to HW, but not SW lldm, 
         * OpenCV good support for Linux. Support for standards and HW.
         * OpenCV layer on top of inference engine. CPU's are quite competitive
            * Then ARM, Risk-V
* ONNX
   * Like a standard, but good for recog, but doesn't support detection for example
   * Should we participate in ONNX board?
   * Platform: Intel, Risk-V, ARM and NVidia (leverage what they have. Cuda perhaps)
      * OpenCV should be seamless
* We should begin a kickstarter test

* Development notes:
   1. Xperience.AI team continue work on open PRs and some tickets. Igor is working on QR code related issues. Alexander will work on JavaScript related changes. Current amount of PRs: 80 - in main repo, 47 - in contrib.
   2. Cudev module from contrib is required for OpenCV build with CUDA. Alexander S does initial study of the module and will continue to work on it. The module is header only template library for math expressions and cv-related primitives. Current idea: extract topic functions to cudaarithm, cudaimgproc and other modules from cudev and move remaining part to core library. Possible solutions: OpenCV module or "3rdparty" library in the same way as HAL implementation.
   3. Alexander Alekhin is working on bit-exact MedianBlur implementation: there are a lot of failed tests in core library and contrib. Also found strange MedianBlur usage in SURF (20x20) and ORB.
   4. External developers have found and reported security vulnerability in OpenCV. Alexander added SECURITY.md file to the repo for such cases, Vadim created security@opencv.org list to get private security reports. Intel team will work on the issue handling as it affects OpenVINO and related products.
   5. Vadim will conduct a seminar about universal intrinsics and HAL in Xperience.AI office at 14:00 MSK, November 14. Intel team will join with Hangout (invitation sent).
   6. OpenCV team has notes about CI configuration and PR testing options on Wiki (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/CI-configuration)

               * OpenVino allows asynchronous API, latency is hidden
               * Find HW partners
               * Reference design from OpenCV 
         * ONNX detection, pose can invent layers, mask-RNN can suggest to committee

## 2019-09-25

## __*Agenda*__
* New Distributed development coming
* GPU/CPU compatibility
* Pull requests
* Blog
* Video
* GSoC

### *__Minutes__*
New distributed development:

### **General**

* OpenCV development will be distributed between:
   * Intel team (represented by Alexander);
   * Xperience team (initially 1 person + Alex as maintainer): main priority now is healthy PR review and bug fix process;
   * OpenCV China team (led by Vadim, expected to have 4 employees in ShenZhen this winter): responsible for ARM / Embedded device support.

### **PRs**

The plan is to have only a few maintainers able to merge PRs. 
* Intel team: Alexander A;
* Xperience team: Alexander S;
* OpenCV China team: Vadim.

It's restricted to merge PRs at 2 AM-10 AM UTC+3 due to nightly builds.
Review process: first thing is to analyze header file changes (to avoid incompatibility). 
While reviewing PR, we can add our patches on top to make the code better / push PR faster.

### **Roadmap**
* Branches: 2.4 is stalled,
* 3.4 accepts only optimizations and fixes. 
* 4.2 release is expected in December. 

In general, a new version is released once a quarter.

* Starting with version 4.0 source code compatibility is guaranteed and tested automatically. 
* Exceptions: 
   * contrib, 
   * DNN module, 
   * Graph API. 


* GPU/CPU compatability
   * [Sycl](https://www.khronos.org/sycl/)
> Sycl is a royalty-free, cross-platform abstraction layer that builds on the underlying concepts, portability and efficiency of OpenCL that enables code for heterogeneous processors to be written in a “single-source” style using completely standard C++
   * Some [experimental sycl patches](https://github.com/intel/llvm/releases/tag/2019-09) by the Intel team
* Pull requests
   * We are hiring a full-time contractor from Deepseez to handle pull requests
      * Deepseez is advancing this
   * Needs to be done in coordination to what Intel team is working on
   * We will prioritize finishing off GSoC 2019 pull requests first
      * When we are done, Gary will note where those are incorporated in on the [ideas page](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019)
   * We are trying to set up a distributed team. China team (via Hong Kong and Shenzhen University) will also join in, with some full time developers and probably Vadim too
* Blog
   * Now, below on https://opencv.org/, we've started blog posts on 
   * Haven't set the protocol yet. 
* Video for GSoC 2019
   * They are listed on the [ideas page](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2019)
   * Gary is looking for a video editor and music maker
      * Satya has bought music that he made in case Gary can't find
* GSoC payments
   * We think by Sept 30th.

## __*Agenda*__
* GSoC Final period

### *__Minutes__*
* GSoC grading period is Aug 19-26
   * Must send out notice to get reviews in
* DNN via ONNX is hard
   * No way of knowing how hard porting a model is
       * Landmarks, segmentation
      * Classification, segmentation, landmarks, validate and high level API
   * Missing many ops for conversion-driven by specific models
   * Could piggyback on another runtime
      * Inference only
      * Compositional heads to fine-tune on different tasks only?
      * Hyperparameter only search given data automl on google does something like this
   * Or go through tensor flow only
   * OpenVino has a separate repository

   * Evolved by model cherry picking
   * NVidia inference engine in github already embedded in the tensorflow option
      * Open sourced on github (CUDA) tensor RT stuff

* GSoC
* Google Summer of Docs
* Chips
* Python

### *__Minutes__*
* GSoC
   * look into gooogle summer of docs. 
   * Get mentors going on sorting through students.
      * 165 applications to opencv from our site
      * 447 Students on our student list. Need to sort down
   * Students need to come up with their actual plan. Mentors need to find and refine
   * Already people on (sample)
      * Facial landmark focus (Satya)
      * Alpha matting (Sunita)
         * Non deep grabcut, alpha matting
      * DNN GPU (Davis King) Justin
* GSoDocs
   * Here is the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/timeline)
      * Application is due April 2nd
* Embedded chips. OpenCV should work with
   * Jetson nano
   * TPU
   * Intel
   * Other? Huawei? Smart cameras?
* Python is very important to opencv/vision (OpenCV python wrapper is getting 1M downloads per week!)
   * If you look at the OpenCV docs, for [example here](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html), it looks all C++
      * Only when you click to the actual function, for example [getPerspectiveTransform](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/d54/group__imgproc__transform.html#gae66ba39ba2e47dd0750555c7e986ab85) do you see, below the C++ interface is the python interface `Python:
retval	=	cv.getPerspectiveTransform(	src, dst[, solveMethod]	)
`
   * Possibly we can use Google summer of docs to bring out the python interface more
