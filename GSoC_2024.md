# Ideas:

1. #### _IDEA:_ GPT with OpenCV 2
   * ***Description:*** Tune GPT on latest OpenCV; create examples/blog on how to use GPT to leverage DNN and other OpenCV functionality; create an OpenAI GPT API assuming we get such access off the waitlist.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * Tuning GPT on OpenCV 4.7+ code and Github bases.
      * Documentation and blog or YouTube videos of using GPT to leverage OpenCV functions and internals of OpenCV
      * Assuming we get earlyÂ access to the GPT API, create an API that has useful functionality toÂ OpenCV and its applications.
         * Potentially have some DNN models where users can tune the models to their data that they provide, but GPT would know how to trains such models and get them on given hardware like OAK cameras, Mac, Windows, Linux.Â  Â 
   * ***Resources:*** [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Git Code](https://github.com/opencv), [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Good software development skills, good knowledge and use of GPT and of OpenCV.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Doug Lee, Gary Bradski
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium to Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 200 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ NeRFs 2
   * ***Description:*** Create an easy but accurate NeRF code for users to capture NeRF models with. Possibly allow accuracy boosts using Charuco boards in thescene
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * NeRF code and application, well documented for ease of user's capturing NeRF models
      * Documentation and YouTube videos showing how to use it.Â 
   * ***Resources:*** [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Example NeRF Code](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Good software development skills, good knowledge and use of NeRF models.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Doug Lee, Gary Bradski
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium to Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Quantized models for OpenCV Model Zoo
   * ***Description:*** Many modern CPUs, GPUs and specialized NPUs include special instructions and hardware blocks for accelerated inference, especially for INT8 inference. The models don't just become ~4x smaller compared to FP32  original models, the inference speed increases significantly (by 2x-4x or more) as well. The number of quantized models steadily increases, however, beyond image classification there are not so many 8-bit computer vision models with proven high-quality results. We will be interested to add to our model zoo (https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo) 8-bit models for object detection, optical flow, pose estimation, text detection and recognition etc.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * Series of patches to OpenCV Zoo and maybe to OpenCV DNN (when OpenCV DNN misses 8-bit flavors of certain operations) to add the corresponding models.
      * If quantization is performed by student during the project, we will request the corresponding scripts to perform the quantization
      * Benchmark results to prove the quality of the quantized models along with the corresponding scripts so that we can reproduce it.
   * ***Skills Required:*** very good ML engineering skills, good Python programming skills, familiarity with model quantization algorithms and model quality assessment approaches
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Feng Yuantao, Zhong Wanli, Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ RISC-V Optimizations
   * ***Description:*** RISC-V is one of main target platforms for OpenCV. During past several years we brought in some RISC-V optimizations based on RISC-V Vector extension by adding another backend to _OpenCV scalable universal intrinsics_. We refactored a lot of code in OpenCV to make the vectorized loops compatible with RISC-V backend and more or less efficient. Still, we see a lot of gaps and the performance of certain functions can be further improved. For some critical functions, like convolution in deep learning, it makes sense perhaps to implement custom loops using native RVV intrinsics instead of using OpenCV scalable universal intrinsics. This is what we invite you to do.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * A series of patches for core, imgproc, video and dnn modules to bring improved loops that use OpenCV scalable universal intrinsics or native RVV intrinsics to improve the performance. In the first case the optimizations should not degrade performance on other major platforms like x86-64 or ARMv8 with NEON.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV Wide Universal Intrinsics Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html)
      * [Implementation of wide universal intrinsics for various platforms, including RISC-V](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/hal)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; good skills of optimizing code using SIMD.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Mingjie Xing, Maxim Shabunin
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Dynamic CUDA support in DNN
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV DNN module includes several backends for efficient inference on various platforms. Some of the backends are heavy and bring in a lot of dependencies, so it makes sense to make the backends dynamic. Recently, we did it with OpenVINO backend: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21745. The goal of this project is to make CUDA backend of OpenCV DNN dynamic as well. Once it's implemented, we can have a single set of OpenCV binaries and then add the necessary plugin (also in binary form) to accelerate inference on NVidia GPUs without recompiling OpenCV.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * A series of patches for dnn and maybe core module to build OpenCV DNN CUDA plugin as a separate binary that could be used by OpenCV DNN. In this case OpenCV itself should not have any dependency of CUDA SDK or runtime - the plugin should encapsulate it. It is fine if the user-supplied tensors (cv::Mat) are automatically uploaded to GPU memory by the engine (cv::dnn::Net) before the inference and the output tensors are downloaded from GPU memory after the inference in such a case.
   * ***Resources:***
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; good practical experience in CUDA. Acquaintance with deep learning is desirable but not necessary, since the project is mostly about software engineering, not about ML algorithms or their optimization.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Alexander Smorkalov
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Improve DNN Vulkan Backend
   * ***Description:*** Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform API 3D graphics and computing. And It's intended to offer higher performance and more efficient CPU and GPU. GPU chips are already in mobile phones, PCs, and even some development boards. In order for the DNN model to benefit from the GPU, we will use Vulkan to call the GPU. Actually, in 2018, OpenCV supported Vulkan backend ([PR 12703](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/12703)). However, due to too few supported Vulkan layers and the lack of necessary speed optimization, the current Vulkan backend is very slow. The goal of this project is to let more layers support Vulkan and accelerate layers that are already supported.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * Improve/Support Vulkan layer in OpenCV DNN modules. For now, we can just focus on FP32 precision.
      * A list of higher priority layers:
        * Fully support [NaryEltwise Layer](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/4.x/modules/dnn/src/layers/nary_eltwise_layers.cpp), the key is broadcast mechanism.
        * Some activation layers like Mesh, Ceil, Celu, Selu, Sigmoid, HardSigmoid, etc.
        * Fully Connected/GEMM layer
        * Reshape layer
        * DeConvolution layer
        * Flatten layer
        * BatchNorm layer
   * ***Resources:***
         * 1. [Vulkan implementation of NCNN](https://github.com/Tencent/ncnn/tree/master/src/layer/vulkan)
         * 2. [Vulkan implementation of MNN](https://github.com/alibaba/MNN/tree/master/source/backend/vulkan)
         * 3. [Vulkan implementation of Tengine](https://github.com/OAID/Tengine/tree/tengine-lite/source/device/vulkan)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery of C++; good practical experience in Vulkan; at least a basic understanding of computer vision and deep learning technologies.
   * ***Difficulty:*** Difficult
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Zihao Mu, Shiqi Yu
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ OpenGL support with GTK 3 and GTK 4
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV 4.x supports integration with GTK 2, but it's out of date for most of modern Linux distribution. GTK 3+ provides new API for OpenGL integration that needs to be supported in OpenCV 4.x+.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * Highgui GTK 3+ backend for OpenGL
   * ***Skills Required:*** C++, practice with Linux.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** < your name goes here >
   * ***Difficulty:*** <Easy, Medium, Hard>

1. #### _IDEA:_ Add support for libcamera
   * ***Description:*** Discussion: [#21653](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/21653).
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * Default camera support on Raspberry Pi
  * ***Resources:***
         * [For example a paper citation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.08091.pdf)
         * [For example an existing feature request](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/11013)
         * [Possibly an existing related module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/optflow) that includes some new optical flow algorithms.
   * ***Skills Required:*** < for example mastery plus experience coding in C++, college course work in vision that covers optical flow, python. Best if you have also worked with deep neural networks. >
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** < your name goes here >
   * ***Difficulty:*** <Easy, Medium, Hard>

# **Contributors**

## **How to Apply**

The process is described at [GSoC home page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)

## **How contributors will be evaluated once working:**

- Contributors will be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of contribution
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has all or most of the planned functionality (but still usable without those missing parts)
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has some unit tests
            - Has a tutorial/sample of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
       - Optionally, but highly desirable: create a (short! 30sec-1min) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your project. We will use it to create the final video:
            - [The 2021 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6He1Ay7hfQc)
            - [The 2020 Movie](https://youtu.be/ROGa2tutPHQ)
            - [The 2015 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s)
            - [The 2014 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA)
            - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)
    - **Extended period:**
        - TBD

-----------------

# Mentors:

1.  Contact us, preferably in February or early March, on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * [Mentor only list](https://groups.google.com/g/opencv_mentors)
       * [The Contributor+Mentor Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2023)
4.  You then:
    - Look through the ideas above, choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through the project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen.
       - Find likely contributors, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of contributors who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a contributor or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your contributors officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) prior to the deadline as indicate by the Contributor Application Period in the [time line](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2023#important-dates)
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6. Contributors must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable contributor **and** we give you a slot **and** the contributor signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations.
   - Thank you for trying.
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
