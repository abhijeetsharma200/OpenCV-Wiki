# Ideas:

1. #### _IDEA:_ NeRFs
   * ***Description:*** Create an easy but accurate NeRF/Gaussian Splatting code for users to capture NeRF/Gaussian Splatting models with. Possibly allow accuracy boosts using Charuco boards in the scene
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * NeRF/Gaussian Splatting code and application, well documented for ease of user's capturing NeRF models
      * Documentation and YouTube videos showing how to use it.Â 
   * ***Resources:*** [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Example NeRF Code](https://docs.nerf.studio/)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Good software development skills, good knowledge of and use of NeRF/Gaussian Splatting models.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Doug Lee, Gary Bradski
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium to Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours


1. #### _IDEA:_ RISC-V Optimizations
   * ***Description:*** RISC-V is one of main target platforms for OpenCV. During past several years we brought in some RISC-V optimizations based on RISC-V Vector extension by adding another backend to _OpenCV scalable universal intrinsics_. We refactored a lot of code in OpenCV to make the vectorized loops compatible with RISC-V backend and more or less efficient. Still, we see a lot of gaps and the performance of certain functions can be further improved. For some critical functions, like convolution in deep learning, it makes sense perhaps to implement custom loops using native RVV intrinsics instead of using OpenCV scalable universal intrinsics. This is what we invite you to do.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * A series of patches for core, imgproc, video and dnn modules to bring improved loops that use OpenCV scalable universal intrinsics or native RVV intrinsics to improve the performance. In the first case the optimizations should not degrade performance on other major platforms like x86-64 or ARMv8 with NEON.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV Wide Universal Intrinsics Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html)
      * [Implementation of wide universal intrinsics for various platforms, including RISC-V](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/hal)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; good skills of optimizing code using SIMD.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Mingjie Xing, Maxim Shabunin
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Dynamic CUDA support in DNN
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV DNN module includes several backends for efficient inference on various platforms. Some of the backends are heavy and bring in a lot of dependencies, so it makes sense to make the backends dynamic. Recently, we did it with OpenVINO backend: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21745. The goal of this project is to make CUDA backend of OpenCV DNN dynamic as well. Once it's implemented, we can have a single set of OpenCV binaries and then add the necessary plugin (also in binary form) to accelerate inference on NVidia GPUs without recompiling OpenCV.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * A series of patches for dnn and maybe core module to build OpenCV DNN CUDA plugin as a separate binary that could be used by OpenCV DNN. In this case OpenCV itself should not have any dependency of CUDA SDK or runtime - the plugin should encapsulate it. It is fine if the user-supplied tensors (cv::Mat) are automatically uploaded to GPU memory by the engine (cv::dnn::Net) before the inference and the output tensors are downloaded from GPU memory after the inference in such a case.
   * ***Resources:***
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; good practical experience in CUDA. Acquaintance with deep learning is desirable but not necessary, since the project is mostly about software engineering, not about ML algorithms or their optimization.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Alexander Smorkalov
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours


1. #### _IDEA:_ OpenGL support with GTK 3 and GTK 4
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV 4.x supports integration with GTK 2, but it's out of date for most of modern Linux distribution. GTK 3+ provides new API for OpenGL integration that needs to be supported in OpenCV 4.x+.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * Highgui GTK 3+ backend for OpenGL
   * ***Skills Required:*** C++, practice with Linux.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** TBD
   * ***Difficulty:*** <Easy, Medium, Hard>


1. #### _IDEA:_  Improved imgcodecs
   * ***Description:***  It's not a single big project but rather a series of tasks under the "image codecs" umbrella. The goal is to make a series of improvements in the existing opencv_imgcodecs module, including, but not limited to, the following items (please, feel free to propose your ideas):
      * enable inline assembly in libjpeg-turbo in order to boost performance.
      * provide extra API to read image header separately from the image data (probably, it should be a callback or something like that provided, or there should be some optional limits for image resolution).
      * support animation encoding/decoding.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * imgcodecs new API
   * ***Skills Required:*** C++, practice with Linux.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vincent Rabaud
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

### _Idea Template:_
```
1. #### _IDEA:_ <Descriptive Title>
   * ***Description:*** 3-7 sentences describing the task
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***

      * <i.e. create a new module called "bla bla">
      * < Has method to accomplish X >
      * <...>

* ## **All Ideas Above**
   1. #### Have these Additional Expected Outcomes:
      * Use the [OpenCV How to Contribute](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute) and [Aruco module in opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco) as a guide.
      * Add unit tests [described here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/QA_in_OpenCV), see also the [Aruco test example](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/test)
      * Add a tutorial, and sample code
         * see the [Aruco tutorials](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/tutorials) and how they [look on the web](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/d6d/tutorial_table_of_content_aruco.html).
         * See the [Aruco samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/samples)
      * Make a short video showing off your algorithm and post it to Youtube. [Here's an Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5P65CYqo_Q).

# **Contributors**

## **How to Apply**

The process is described at [GSoC home page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)

## **How contributors will be evaluated once working:**

- Contributors will be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of contribution
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has all or most of the planned functionality (but still usable without those missing parts)
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for
            - Has some unit tests
            - Has a tutorial/sample of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
       - Optionally, but highly desirable: create a (short! 30sec-1min) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your project. We will use it to create the final video:
            - [The 2021 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6He1Ay7hfQc)
            - [The 2020 Movie](https://youtu.be/ROGa2tutPHQ)
            - [The 2015 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s)
            - [The 2014 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA)
            - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)
    - **Extended period:**
        - TBD

-----------------

# Mentors:

1.  Contact us, preferably in February or early March, on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * [Mentor only list](https://groups.google.com/g/opencv_mentors)
       * [opencv-gsoc-202X mailing list](https://groups.google.com/g/opencv-gsoc-202x)
4.  You then:
    - Look through the ideas above, choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through the project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen.
       - Find likely contributors, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of contributors who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a contributor or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your contributors officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) prior to the deadline as indicate by the Contributor Application Period in the [time line](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2024#important-dates)
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6. Contributors must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable contributor **and** we give you a slot **and** the contributor signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations.
   - Thank you for trying.
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
