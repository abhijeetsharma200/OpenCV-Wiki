* Status: Open
* Platforms: All
* Complexity: Several man-weeks to a few man-months

## Introduction and Rationale
[AVX512](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVX-512) instructions have been introduced a few years ago, first as a part of instruction set of the special accelerator Xeon Phi, and then they have been added to some workstation-class and server-class CPUs (Skylake-X). The upcoming Icelake arch, which will target a wide range of devices, from servers downto ultra-portable laptops, should have AVX512 on board, so in theory in a few years from now (2019 Feb) AVX512 should become as common as SSE4.x and AVX2 nowadays.

AVX512 offers 32 512-bit registers (twice as much twice as wide registers, comparing to AVX2), some advanced instructions, including extensive mask support etc. In principle, AVX512 should provide noticeable boost in performance, comparing to SSE4 and AVX2, or the same performance with lower power consumption, because there are roughly 2x less instructions needed to perform the same task, so CPU can operate at lower clock speed. All in all, it makes sense prepare OpenCV for AVX512 era.

OpenCV 4.0 has partial support for AVX512. First of all, on x64 OpenCV uses IPPICV, which includes AVX512-optimized functions. Also, our [CMake scripts and the dynamic dispatching mechanism](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/CPU-optimizations-build-options) support AVX512 (there are two options, AVX512F and AVX512_SKX) and there are a few places, e.g. convolution kernel in DNN module, that use it. Nevertheless, it's very far from being complete. We need much more, and we need to get there with minimal efforts.

## Proposed solution

In OpenCV we have well established and time-tested [Universal Intrinsics](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html), which we converted to [Wide Universal Intrinsics](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/OE-27.-Wide-Universal-Intrinsics) in OpenCV 4.0

## Impact on existing code, compatibility

## Possible alternatives
As mentioned earlier, AVX512 already exists in some form. The introduction of AVX512 backend of Wide Univ. Intrinsics can be postponed, and we can just accelerate critical loops by direct use of AVX512 intrinsics, but it will take noticeably more efforts at the implementation and, what's also important, at the support phase. So it's rather "when" than "if" question.
