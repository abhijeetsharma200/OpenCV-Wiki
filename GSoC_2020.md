Student Info
-------------------------------------

* ## **How students will be evaluated once working:**

- Student projects to be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of student code
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has basic functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has basic unit test
            - Has a tutorial of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
    - **End of summer:**
        - A full pull request
            - Full Doxygen documentation
            - A good unit test
            - Example of use/tutorial of the code or net
        - Create a (short!) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your code
            - We use this to create an overall summary. Past years:
                - [The 2015 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s)
                - [The 2014 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA)
                - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)

OpenCV Project Ideas List:

| Index | to | Ideas | Below |

-----------------

### **How to Apply**

OpenCV is taking part in [GSoC 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Below is a list of ideas from developers, staff and [Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals). 


1. **Requirements:**
   - You **must** already know how to program fluently in C++!
   - Some projects may instead specifically require Python or javascript
   - Some projects may require knowledge of Deep Nets and perhaps one or more of the standard packages:
      - PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet. Familiarity with OpenCV's DNN ([here for code](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/dnn) and [here for samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn)) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) deep net exchange is a big plus
1. **Please familiarize yourself with the:** 
   1. [OpenCV Developer's site](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki), the 
   1. [User's site](https://opencv.org/), read through the ideas list below to see which projects are of interest to you, and familiarize yourself with:
   1. The [GSoC 2020 timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline)
1. **Sign up:** for the [OpenCV_GSoC_2020 mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/opencv-gsoc-2020) where you can ask questions, exchange and discuss ideas with students and mentors, get announcements etc.
1. **Optional steps mentors may take:**
   * Mentors may contact you for hangouts or other means of live interview
   * You may be asked for proof of coding
   * You will probably be asked for a full project plan
1. **How to enhance your application:**
   1. Contributing to OpenCV is a **big plus**. Some suggestions:
      1. Fixing an [bug/issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues) or
      1. Very advanced people can already start delivering code for the idea they like to their mentor
      1. More realistically and still **great**: REALLY learn some OpenCV function and contribute a well-written tutorial on it

* ## **All Ideas Above**
   1. #### Have these Additional Expected Outcomes:
      * Use the [OpenCV How to Contribute](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute) and [Aruco module in opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco) as a guide.
      * Add unit tests [described here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/QA_in_OpenCV), see also the [Aruco test example](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/test)
      * Add a tutorial, and sample code 
         * see the [Aruco tutorials](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/tutorials) and how they [look on the web](https://docs.opencv.org/master/d9/d6d/tutorial_table_of_content_aruco.html).
         * See the [Aruco samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco/samples)
      * Make a short video showing off your algorithm and post it to Youtube. [Here's an Example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5P65CYqo_Q).

For computer vision professionals interested in mentoring
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  Contact us by March 15th on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * [The Mentor Only Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv_mentors_2020)
       * [The Student+Mentor Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2020)
       * The Proposals Spreadsheet TBD
4.  You then:
    - Look through the ideas above, choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through student project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen. 
       - Find likely students, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of students who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a student or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your students officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) before March 16th.
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6.  Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable student **and** we give you a slot **and** the student signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations. 
   - Thank you for trying. 
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
