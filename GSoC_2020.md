1. #### _IDEA:_ Optimize OpenCV for RISC-V
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV provides a convenient method to port many optimized kernels at once to a new CPU, as long as that CPU supports SIMD instructions. We use so-called *Wide Universal Intrinsics* for that. By adding implementation of the wide universal intrinsics for RISC-V we can make OpenCV run pretty efficiently on RISC-V CPUs.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * intrin_riscv.hpp added to `opencv_core` module. It does not have to implement all of the intrinsics. We can start with vector single-precision floating-point arithmetics that would be sufficient for OpenCV DNN acceleration.
      * tweaking OpenCV CMake scripts to let OpenCV cross-compile for RISC-V (Linux OS).
      * make the *wide universal intrinsics* regression tests pass on the software simulator (QEMU)
   * ***Resources:***

   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; basic skills of optimizing code using SIMD.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky, Alexander Smorkalov
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Better SIFT in the main repository
   * ***Description:*** In 2020 March the patent on one of the most popular feature detection algorithm, SIFT, expires. So, we can move the implementation from opencv_contrib/xfeatures2d to the main OpenCV repository (opencv/features2d) in the late spring or summer. We can also optimize and improve it further, probably create bit-exact implementation.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Transfer SIFT implementation, together with the tests, to the main OpenCV repository.
      * Convert Intel-specific AVX2 intrinsics used in the implementation to wide universal intrinsics.
      * (optional) Convert it to bit-exact implementation that does not use floating-point operations. Maybe just the detector part.
      * Add A-SIFT into the C++ interface. Right now there is Python script to compute A-SIFT on top of SIFT. It can be converted to C++ for better efficiency (including parallel processing of the transformed images).
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Current SIFT Implementation in OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/blob/master/modules/xfeatures2d/src/sift.cpp)
      * [OpenCV Wide Universal Intrinsics Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html)
      * [A-SIFT Example in Python](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/python/asift.py)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; basic skills of optimizing code using SIMD; basic knowledge about feature points in images, what they are about, how to use them.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vitaly Tuzov, Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ Revise/improve Text & Digit Recognition Samples
   * ***Description:*** In OpenCV there are several quite boring samples on digit and text recognition, digits.cpp, digits.py, letter_recog.cpp ... . In the modern deep learning era they can be done in much better way. In particular, instead of using classical algorithms in letter_recog.cpp, we can extend OpenCV deep learning-based text detection sample and run some network to recognize the detected text, at least English text. In digits.cpp/.py we can take the live image from camera, use connected component analysis to detect potential regions with each digit (let's assume we snow to the camera a white paper sheet with hand-written digits in black/blue/green/red etc. color) and then run a classical Yann LeCun's LeNet-5 network, which is very compact, so it can be included into the repository or easily downloaded from the net. To make the recognition more stable, each region may be rotated several times, i.e. run through the network under different angles.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Completely rework digits.cpp (digits_video.py does something like that, but it's broken now) to use a live feed from camera instead of static images. Segment digits, run LeNet-5 or similar convolutional network to recognize the digits. Display the recognized digits as overlays on top of the original digits.
      * Remove letter_recog.cpp from opencv/samples/cpp. Instead, add opencv/samples/dnn/text_recog.cpp (or text_recog.py) that will not only detect text, but will recognize it.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Current Python Samples including digits_video.py and digits.py](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/python)
      * [Classical LeNet-5 Architecture for hand-written digit recognition](https://engmrk.com/lenet-5-a-classic-cnn-architecture/)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++ and Python; good knowledge of basic image processing (connected components analysis) and deep learning.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Jia Wu
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium (just digits) to Hard (digits & text recognition)

1. #### _IDEA:_ Add Robust Plane/Sphere/Cylinder Fitting into 3D Point Clouds
   * ***Description:*** It's time to start extending OpenCV 3D handling capabilities. One of the important components of 3D Point Cloud processing pipeline is detection of some canonical 3D shapes that make up the cloud. In the urban environments, such as homes, offices, factories, cities, such canonical shapes (planes mostly, sometimes cylinders, occasionally spheres) often occur and they play important role in the 3D scene analysis. In OpenCV we have `opencv_contrib/rgbd` module with some algorithms for 3D cloud processing. Plane, cylinder and sphere fitting would be a useful addition to this set of algorithms.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Add plane fitting into `opencv_contrib/rgbd' module. It should not be just a single plane fitting. It should be segmentation, where the found plane is "subtracted" from the scene and another plane (or other shape) fitting algorithm is applied to the remaining point cloud. Regression test should be added, based on some real or synthetic data.
      * Similarly to the above item, cylinder and sphere fitting should be added as well. In general, we should be able to decompose the scene into a number of planes, cylinders, sheres and the "other" objects.
      * (Optional) Support for non-canonical clusters (based on their compactness, for example) would be nice to have as well.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [A part of Point Cloud Library, which we can probably use as a reference implementation](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/tree/master/sample_consensus/include/pcl/sample_consensus)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; basic knowledge of 3D point cloud processing principles, model fitting, RANSAC.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Rostislav Vasilikhin, Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Write a tutorial about training a network in PyTorch and then running it in OpenCV
   * ***Description:*** PyTorch is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks. It supports export of the trained models into ONNX format, which is also very popular. OpenCV is becoming quite popular tool for Deep Learning Inference. It would be very useful to describe clearly how to train a model in PyTorch so that it can be run then in OpenCV.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Write a tutorial that will explain the whole pipeline step by step. Take object detection as the example task. ONNX does not provide all those standard layers for object detection, but OpenCV covers this missing part. Describe it clearly.
      * The tutorial should include some basic information (or a link) how to configure PyTorch, get dataset, train the detection network, and then how to export it to ONNX. Full script should be provided
      * The tutorial should also include description and the whole OpenCV-based example that will read the trained network and will run it on the live video stream from camera.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
      * [ONNX](https://onnx.ai)
      * [OpenCV Object Detection Example](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/dnn/object_detection.py). For the tutorial it's too complex. Much simpler one is needed.
   * ***Skills Required:*** good practical experience in DeepLearning, including PyTorch. Good Python coding skills. Very good English.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Dmitry Kurtaev, Jia Wu
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ Write a tutorial about using universal intrinsics and `cv::parallel_for_` for efficient cross-platform algorithm implementation
   * ***Description:*** Universal intrinsics is OpenCV way to write cross-platform and yet very efficient code on a variety of platforms. The technique is widely used inside OpenCV, but it's not well-known to many OpenCV users, including contributors, who are supposed to provide high-quality fast code into OpenCV. This tutorial should fill this important missing part of the documentation.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * A tutorial + source code that will explain how to use the universal intrinsics. It should also have an overview of what are intrinsics, what are vector (SIMD) instructions. Some tricks (e.g. how to process the "tails" of image rows that do not fit SIMD register), useful intrinsics should be covered as well.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV Wide Universal Intrinsics Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html)
   * ***Skills Required:*** good experience in C++, some experience with code optimization. Very good English.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vitaly Tuzov, Shiqi Yu
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ Computer vision data augmentation module
   * ***Description:*** Deep learning networks are hungry for data and data augmentation is one of the easiest ways to increase data variation. Augmentation could be as simple image flipping, cropping and scaling on up to more complicated transformations such style transfer using another deep learning network. For computer vision problems, OpenCV is often used for reading images in most of training scenarios, so why we'd like to enhance data reading with simple to use data augmentation techniques as well.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      1. Analyze which image transformations are widely used for image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation problems.
           - Things that help with data augmentation for training networks
              - Lighting functions
              - spherical or cylindrical views around a planar object
              - noise ...
              - for 3D point clouds
      1. Create a new OpenCV's module (or use an existing one such `datasets` or `dnn`?) with at least the following functionality:
           - Provide an API to apply single transformations to an Image or batch of Images, Rectangles (i.e. for ground truth for object detection), Masks.
           - Let users combine different transformations in the class object which can apply them with some probability.
           - Custom data transformations which can be included in the augmentation classes.
      1. Write tutorials targeting on Python wrappers due it's the most popular language supported by different DL frameworks right now.
           - These should in particular show use with PyTorch and TensorFlow.
   * ***Skills Required:*** Experience in image processing and deep learning networks training for computer vision problems.
   * ***Mentors:*** Dmitry Kurtaev
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ Add automatically generated Julia bindings for OpenCV
   * ***Description:*** Julia language is becoming a popular solution for computing, for research, as it's similar to Python and provides built-in array support.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Automatically generated bindings for Julia + a few samples (probably translated from Python). The same OpenCV header parser as for Python, Java etc. should be used. Python bindings generator can be used as a starting point.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Julia Bindings for OpenCV. Evolution Proposal](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/OE-31.-Julia-Bindings)
      * [Python Bindings for OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/python)
      * [Python Samples for OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/python)
   * ***Skills Required:*** good expertise in C++ and Julia, very good expertise in Python.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** ???
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Create nuget package for OpenCV and OpenCV contrib.
   * ***Description:*** Nuget is the standard Microsoft package manager. If done properly, it can become the most convenient way to install OpenCV on Windows. We can also create opencv_contrib nuget package, and thus provide a convenient way for OpenCV users to install experimental OpenCV functionality on Windows.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * scripts to automatically generate 2 nuget packages: for OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib. Probably, even finer-grain nuget packages can be created, e.g. one for the main OpenCV and then one per each opencv_contrib module. But 2 will be good enough to start with.
      * publish OpenCV nuget packages at [NuGet Gallery](nuget.org)
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV 3.x nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenCV.Net)
      * [An Introduction to NuGet from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget)
   * ***Skills Required:*** good expertise in C++ and Windows development.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** ???
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

# **Students**

## **How to Apply**

OpenCV is taking part in [GSoC 2020](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). Below is a list of ideas from developers, staff and [Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals). 

1. **Requirements:**
   - You **must** already know how to program fluently in C++!
   - Some projects may instead specifically require Python or javascript
   - Some projects may require knowledge of Deep Nets and perhaps one or more of the standard packages:
      - PyTorch, TensorFlow, MXNet. Familiarity with OpenCV's DNN ([here for code](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/dnn) and [here for samples](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/samples/dnn)) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/) deep net exchange is a big plus
1. **Please familiarize yourself with the:** 
   1. [OpenCV Developer's site](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki), the 
   1. [User's site](https://opencv.org/), read through the ideas list below to see which projects are of interest to you, and familiarize yourself with:
   1. The [GSoC 2020 timeline](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline)
1. **Sign up:** for the [OpenCV_GSoC_2020 mailing list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/opencv-gsoc-2020) where you can ask questions, exchange and discuss ideas with students and mentors, get announcements etc.
1. **Optional steps mentors may take:**
   * Mentors may contact you for hangouts or other means of live interview
   * You may be asked for proof of coding
   * You will probably be asked for a full project plan
1. **How to enhance your application:**
   1. Contributing to OpenCV is a **big plus**. Some suggestions:
      1. Fixing an [bug/issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues) or
      1. Very advanced people can already start delivering code for the idea they like to their mentor
      1. More realistically and still **great**: REALLY learn some OpenCV function and contribute a well-written tutorial on it

## **How students will be evaluated once working:**

- Student projects to be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of student code
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has basic functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has basic unit test
            - Has a tutorial of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
    - **End of summer:**
        - A full pull request
            - Full Doxygen documentation
            - A good unit test
            - Example of use/tutorial of the code or net
        - Create a (short!) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your code
            - We use this to create an overall summary. Past years:

# Mentors:

1.  Contact us by March 15th on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * [The Mentor Only Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv_mentors_2020)
       * [The Student+Mentor Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2020)
       * The Proposals Spreadsheet TBD
4.  You then:
    - Look through the ideas above, choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through student project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen. 
       - Find likely students, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of students who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a student or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your students officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) before March 16th.
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6.  Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable student **and** we give you a slot **and** the student signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations. 
   - Thank you for trying. 
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
