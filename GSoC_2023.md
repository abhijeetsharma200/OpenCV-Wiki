# Ideas:

1. #### _IDEA:_ FP16 and INT8 convolution in OpenCV DNN
   * ***Description:*** Some modern CPUs include hardware support for FP16 arithmetics as well as special instructions for efficient INT8 convolution, which can be used to accelerate deep learning inference. OpenCV includes basic support for FP16 data format, and there is quite efficient implementation of FP16 and INT8 convolution in Ficus NN (https://github.com/vpisarev/ficus/tree/master/lib/NN), but there is no any FP16 compute paths in OpenCV deep learning module and INT8 convolution is quite slow. It's suggested to port FP16 convolution kernels (3x3 Winograd, general im2row convolution) and INT8 im2row convolution from Ficus NN to OpenCV DNN. In the case of FP16 convolution it's just used optionally for FP32 models (we can call it a "low-precision mode") and the necessary conversion from FP32 to FP16 before the convolution and FP16 to FP32 conversion after convolution should be efficiently merged into the convolution loop (not be done in a separate loop) to provide the best efficiency.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Series of patches for OpenCV DNN that add support for FP16 convolution and INT8 convolution into the inference pipeline, the actual operations and the graph engine.
      * Accelerated implementations of QLinearConv, QLinearAdd, QuantizeLinear, DequantizeLinear and other crucial layers to be able to run quantized models
      * Efficient support for QDQ models (https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/performance/quantization.html) where combination of (dequantize + floating-point-op + quantize) operations is replaced, where possible, with dedicated operations (e.g. QLinearConv) and in other cases those quantize & dequantize operations are merged into the corresponding floating-point operations at buffer level in the same parallel loop (to improve cache utilization and reduce a number of parallel regions).
      * Updated OpenCV DNN units tests to test the performance and accuracy of FP16 compute paths and QDQ models.
   * ***Skills Required:*** good software optimization skills, fluent C++ and ARM Assembly, basic understanding of deep learning inference engines
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Zihao Mu, Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Point Cloud Compression
   * ***Description:*** Implement algorithm(s) to compress point clouds and optionally compress meshes. In OpenCV 5.x there is new  [3D module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/5.x/modules/3d) that contains algorithms for 3D data processing. Point cloud is one of the fundamental representations of 3D data and there is growing number of point cloud processing functions, including I/O, RANSAC-based registration, plane fitting etc. Point cloud compression is another desired functionality to add, where we throw away some points from the cloud while preserving the overall geometry that the point cloud implicitly describes.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Point cloud compression algorithm developed for OpenCV 3d module (need to follow OpenCV coding style)
      * Unit tests and at least 1 example in C++ or Python that demonstrates the functionality
      * Documentation/tutorial on how to use this functionality.
      * (optional, but desired) optional integration of OpenCV with [Google's Draco](https://github.com/google/draco) library that provides rich functionality for 3D data compression.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Point cloud compression tutorial from Pointclouds library](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/compression.html)
      * [Introduction to point cloud compression by ZTE](https://res-www.zte.com.cn/mediares/magazine/publication/com_en/article/201803/XUYiling.pdf)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery experience coding in C/C++, good understanding of clustering algorithms and, more generally, 3D data processing algorithms.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Rostislav Vasilikhin
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Simple triangle rendering
   * ***Description:*** Some 3D algorithms require mesh rendering as their inner part, for example as a feedback for 3d reconstruction. Depending on algorithm type, a depth or a color rendering is required. This function can also be used as a simple debugging tool. Since light, shadows and correct texture rendering are separate huge problems, they are out of scope for this task.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      * A function that takes as input a set of points, a set of indices that form triangles and produces depth rendering as output
      * Per-vertex color support is desirable. In that case a function should also take vertex colors as input and produce RGB output
      * Optional: accelerated version using SIMD, OpenCL or OpenGL
      * Optional: jacobians of input parameters as a base for neural rendering
   * ***Resources:***
         * [Triangle rasterization tutorial](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/rasterization-practical-implementation/rasterization-stage)
         * [3D module in OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/next/modules/3d)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; basic skills of optimizing code using SIMD; basic knowledge of 3D math
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Rostislav Vasilikhin
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ 3D samples using OpenGL
   * ***Description:*** 2 years ago we have added basic non-VTK based 3D visualization API into OpenCV and a few corresponding examples (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/20371). The functionality is really useful and the examples are cool, but there are some drawbacks. In particular, the proposed implementation on Linux is only compatible with GTK+ 2.x, but not with the newer versions of GTK+. Support for macOS is also lacking. It's planned to further polish this code and examples and make it all compatible with all major platforms.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Patches for core & highgui to improve compatibility of 3D visualization API with GTK+ 3.x, 4.x and with macOS.
      * A few more examples to demonstrate the functionality in C++ and Python.
      * Optionally, some new 3D visualization functionality
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV vis module tutorial](https://sudonull.com/post/113808-Viz-New-3D-Visualization-Module-in-OpenCV-Library-Intel-Blog)
      * [Essential matrix demo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/cpp/essential_mat_reconstr.cpp). For example, it can be modified to include some 3D visualization, as shown here: https://youtu.be/ROGa2tutPHQ?t=539
   * ***Skills Required:*** good experience with OpenGL and UI frameworks on Linux and macOS (GTK and Cocoa, respectively), basic knowledge of 3D vision algorithms, good C++/Python coding skills.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Shiqi Yu, Alexander Smorkalov
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium to Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Demo for Android
   * ***Description:*** Computer vision on mobile phones is a very popular topic for many years already. Several years ago we added support for mobile platforms (Android and iOS) into OpenCV. Now it's time to refresh and update the corresponding parts (build scripts, examples, tutorials). Let's use the formula: Modern Android + OpenCV + OpenCV Deep learning module + camera (maybe even use depth sensor on phones that have it). It can be a really cool project that will show your skills that that will be extremely helpful for many OpenCV users.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Demo app for Android with all the source code available, no binary blobs or proprietary components.
      * The app should preferably be native (in C++).
      * The app can use camera via native Android API for via OpenCV API. The latter is preferable, but not necessary.
      * The app must use OpenCV DNN module. It should run some deep net using OpenCV and visualize the results (e.g. draw rectangles around found objects, the fancier visualization — the better).
      * The app should work in realtime on any reasonably fast phone. If it's slow, it's better to choose some lighter net or run it on a lower resolution.
      * Preferably the app should not be tightly bound to a particular model. For example, if it's object detection demo, it should be possible to replace one model with another, not via UI, just replace the model file and put the new model name into a config file or into source code.
      * There should be a short tutorial (a markdown file with the key code fragments and some screenshot on how to build it and run.
      * There should be some efforts applied (see https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Compact-build-advice) to make the application compact. That was a separate request from various OpenCV users, and a compact mobile app would be the best example how to do that.
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery experience coding in C/C++ and/or Java, practical experience with developing apps for Android. At least basic understanding of computer vision and deep learning technologies, enough to run a deep net and make it run at realtime speed.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Duration:*** 175 or 350 hours, depending on the feature list

1. #### _IDEA:_ Implement ONNX and numpy operations
   * ***Description:*** Many modern ML frameworks are built in Python or provide Python interface. It's a standard approach to use Python's numpy extension for ML API or at least use numpy as a reference point to describe semantics of tensor processing operations. In particular, a very popular deep learning model representation standard [ONNX](https://onnx.ai) often refers to numpy in the description of ONNX operations. Even though OpenCV provides a number of functions (mostly in the core and dnn modules) to operate on multi-dimensional dense arrays, so far we cannot claim that we provide equivalent functionality with similar API. The goal of this project is to fulfil the gap.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Extended/new functionaity in OpenCV core, dnn modules that matches a subset of numpy and covers most of basic ONNX, TFLITE operations. At minimum, FP32 should be supported. FP16/INT8 support is desirable but optional. In some cases the existing operations should be extended, e.g. add(), subtract() etc. should be extended to support numpy broadcast semantics.
      * A set of unit tests to check the new/extended functionality. Probably, the easiest way to test it would be to use OpenCV Python bindings and develop the unit tests in Python where output from OpenCV will be compared with the output from numpy.
      * A sample/tutorial to demonstrate this functionality. Probably, there can be a table with the list of numpy operations and equivalent OpenCV functions.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [ONNX Operators](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md). Please note, how often numpy is referred to.
      * [Broadcasting on ONNX/numpy](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Broadcasting.md)
      * [Numpy User Guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery experience coding in C/C++, some practical experience with Python and numpy. At least basic understanding of computer vision and deep learning technologies, enough to run a deep net and make it run at realtime speed.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Egor Smirnov, Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Lightweight optical flow model
   * ***Description:*** There is growing OpenCV model zoo, where we focus on practical efficient models for various computer vision tasks that often can replace the traditional algorithms not just in terms of quality, but are also quite competitive in terms of speed. Here are already some efforts done in this direction, e.g. https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07414. The goal of this project is to find several candidates for light-weight optical flow model for OpenCV model zoo, perform comparison for the best quality and speed, select the best candidate or candidates and add the corresponding model, as well as the examples in Python on how to use it. The examples should use OpenCV DNN for the inference. 
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      1. One or more lightweight optical flow models trained (or borrowed if the license is appropriate), quantized if accuracy does not drop too much, and submitted to [OpenCV Model Zoo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo).
      1. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided lightweight optical flow models.
      1. Examples in C++ and Python that demonstrate the use of provided models.
   * ***Skills Required:*** Good Python and C++ coding skills, training and using deep learning, basic knowledge of computer vision
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Yuantao Feng, Shiqi Yu
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Realtime object tracking models
   * ***Description:*** Deep learning techniques impressively improve the performance of object tracking algorithms. Such algorithms have been deployed on some drones and robot dogs, with which people can record videos in a distance without the concern of losing cameras. Computation capacity and power supply can be critical on edge devices such as drones and robot dogs. Object tracking models should be real-time and power-efficient enough to run on edge devices.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      1. One or more lightweight object detection models trained (or borrowed if the license is appropriate), quantized if accuracy does not drop too much, and submitted to [OpenCV Model Zoo](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo).
      1. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided lightweight object detection models.
      1. Examples in C++ and Python that demonstrate the use of provided models.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Multitarget Real-Time Tracking Algorithms for UAV IoT](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/wcmc/2021/9999596/)
      * [Real-time person re-identification at the edge: A mixed precision approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07842)
   * ***Skills Required:*** Good Python and C++ coding skills, training and using deep learning, basic knowledge of computer vision
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Yuantao Feng, Shiqi Yu
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ RISC-V Optimizations
   * ***Description:*** RISC-V is still one of our main target platforms. During past couple of years we brought in some RISC-V optimizations based on RISC-V Vector extension by adding another backend to _OpenCV universal intrinsics_. The implementation works correctly and the latest implementation is also quite efficient, but it introduced some API changes that makes it somewhat incompatible with the majority of vectorized loops in OpenCV. For example, v_add() function should be used instead of the overloaded "+" operator, the number of vector lanes should be captured into a local variable, e.g. using `VTraits<v_float32>::nlanes` instead of using already efficient compile-time constant `v_float32::nlanes`. The goal of this project is to convert many of the vectorized loops in core, imgproc, video and dnn modules to the form which will become compatible with vector extensions and yet will stay compatible with traditional fixed-size SIMD extensions like SSE2, AVX2, NEON etc.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * A series of patches for core, imgproc, video and dnn that will make the code compatible with the new RISC-V extensions without loosing compatibility with existing SIMD extensions. Since it's a lot of boring work, if done manually, we expect that some automated or semi-automated approach is developed and used.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV Wide Universal Intrinsics Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html)
      * [Implementation of wide universal intrinsics for various platforms, including RISC-V](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/hal)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; good skills of optimizing code using SIMD.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Mingjie Xing, Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Dynamic CUDA support in DNN
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV DNN module includes several backends for efficient inference on various platforms. Some of the backends are heavy and bring in a lot of dependencies, so it makes sense to make the backends dynamic. Recently, we did it with OpenVINO backend: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/21745. The goal of this project is to make CUDA backend of OpenCV DNN dynamic as well. Once it's implemented, we can have a single set of OpenCV binaries and then add the necessary plugin (also in binary form) to accelerate inference on NVidia GPUs without recompiling OpenCV.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * A series of patches for dnn and maybe core module to build OpenCV DNN CUDA plugin as a separate binary that could be used by OpenCV DNN. In this case OpenCV itself should not have any dependency of CUDA SDK or runtime - the plugin should encapsulate it. It is fine if the user-supplied tensors (cv::Mat) are automatically uploaded to GPU memory by the engine (cv::dnn::Net) before the inference and the output tensors are downloaded from GPU memory after the inference in such a case.
   * ***Resources:***
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; good practical experience in CUDA. Acquaintance with deep learning is desirable but not necessary, since the project is mostly about software engineering, not about ML algorithms or their optimization.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Alexander Smorkalov
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

1. #### _IDEA:_ Multi-camera calibration part 2
   * ***Description:*** During GSoC 2022 a new cool multi-camera calibration algorithm has been developed: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22363. This year we would like to extend this work with more test cases, tune the accuracy and build higher-level user-friendly tool (based on the script from the tutorial) to perform multi-camera calibration.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * A series of patches with more unit tests and bug fixes for the multi-camera calibration algorithm
      * Tool with convenient API that will be more or less comparable and compatible with Kalibr tool (https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr)
      * New/improved documentation on how to calibrate cameras
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery of C++ and Python, mathematical knowledge of camera calibration, ability to code up mathematical models
   * ***Difficulty:*** Difficult
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Jean-Yves Bouguet
   * ***Duration:*** 175 hours

    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through the project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen.
       - Find likely contributors, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of contributors who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a contributor or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your contributors officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) prior to the deadline as indicate by the Contributor Application Period in the [time line](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2023#important-dates)
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6. Contributors must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable contributor **and** we give you a slot **and** the contributor signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations.
   - Thank you for trying.
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
