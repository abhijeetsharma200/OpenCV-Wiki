!images/opencv-logo.png!

The *O*pen*CV* logo is composed of the 3 capital letters *O, C, V* arranged in a triangle. The logo combines several motifs in the spirit of Open Source and Computer Vision.

The 3 letters O,C,V are reminiscent of the famous "Kanizsa triangle optical illusion":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanizsa_triangle. The letters are shaped after the _*open lock*_  "OpenSource logo":http://www.opensource.org/. The colors symbolize the common RGB color space.
