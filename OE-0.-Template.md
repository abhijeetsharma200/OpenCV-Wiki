## The template for each new OpenCV Evolution Request (put some more verbose title of the evolution proposal here)

* Author: Vadim Pisarevsky (put your name and/or github login here)
* Link: TBD (Here is the link to the corresponding feature request(s) should be provided)
* Status: **Draft**  (the status can be **Draft**, **Open**, **WIP**, it can be **Done** or **Pending**, then the links to the corresponding pull request(s) should be supplied)
* Platforms: **All** (which platforms the evolution request is applicable to; it can be particular CPU arch, GPU arch, OS etc.; it can be **All** in the case of cross-platform algorithms etc.)
* Complexity: N/A (estimated complexity; certain amount of man-weeks, man-months etc.)

## Introduction and Rationale

put some description of what is proposed, why it should be done, and what impact will it make on the library, community, world etc.

## Proposed solution

put any details of the implementation plan, proposed API etc.

## Impact on existing code, compatibility

describe what effect will it have, how much changes we and our users will need to make, if any.

## Possible alternatives

usually, some alternative solutions for the stated problem exist. What are they?
