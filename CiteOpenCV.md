### Why citing OpenCV

If you are using OpenCV in your research-related documents, it is
recommended that you cite OpenCV. This way, other researchers can better
understand your proposed-method. Your method is more reproducible and
thus gaining better credibility.

Below is the BibTex entry for citing OpenCV:
```
@article{opencv_library,
    author = {Bradski, G.},
    citeulike-article-id = {2236121},
    journal = {Dr. Dobb's Journal of Software Tools},
    keywords = {bibtex-import},
    posted-at = {2008-01-15 19:21:54},
    priority = {4},
    title = {{The OpenCV Library}},
    year = {2000}
}
```
