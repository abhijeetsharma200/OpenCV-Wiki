                - [The 2014 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f76HCHJJRA)
                - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)

For students interested in applying
-----------------------------------

1.  You **must** already know how to program fluently in C++
    - Some projects may instead specifically require Python or Matlab skills
2.  Ask to join the [OpenCV GSoC Forum List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017)
    - Discuss projects ideas below or your own ideas with OpenCV mentors on the list now and April.
    - Always title your proposal with what you want to do (example: *Implement Patch Match Stereo Algorithm* )
        - **NOTE:** The above is to discuss proposals with mentors. **BUT**, when the application period starts, you must still sign up with Google Summmer of Code and submit your proposal to the OpenCV organization. If not, you will not show up on the database where we can select you as a student.
3.  In March, Go to the [GSoC site](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) and sign up to be a student with OpenCV
4.  Post the project from below or your own agreed on project on the GSoC to opencv-gsoc-2017@googlegroups.com
    - Include Name, google email, age
    - Include how you think you are qualified to accomplish this project (skills, courses, relevant background)
    - Include Country of origin, school you are enrolled in, Professor you work with (if any)
    - Include a projected timeline and milestones for the project
5.  Once (and if!) OpenCV gets accepted as GSoC org this year, and we are told how many slots we will get **and** you've signed up for a project with us in March before the April 3rd deadline: **Then:**
    - We will weigh the students and projects against the mentors we gather and the mentor's interests and choose which students/project to pursue.
    - Accepted students will be posted on the GSoC site in May (and we will notify the accepted students ourselves).
    - Students are paid over the summer by Google **IF** the mentor accepts the student's work. There are several milestone based go-nogo points.

For computer vision professionals interested in mentoring
---------------------------------------------------------

1.  Contact us on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
4.  You then:
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through student project proposals, find a student and project you like and work with them to refine a realistic proposal that they can implement in a summer (you have to judge whether the student is capable - **absolutely no non-coders in the language you need, typically C++, accepted!** Summer is too short to learn to code and get something done).
        - you may also find (good) students and get them to apply, perhaps to your pet project idea
    - Once you find or create a project proposal that you want to mentor
        - several students might try for the same project
        - alternatively, you might have to convince a student to change projects to one you like or recruit an external student to join Google Summer of Code and apply to your project
    - But, always encourage students to officially apply through the Google Summer of Code site - it helps us and them.
5.  We later get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators then *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6.  Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
    - Sheesh!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable student **and** we give you a slot **and** the student signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor.

It sounds harder than it is.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.

2017 Project Ideas:
===================

Students may propose their own projects (give us a clear summary and why you can do this project). However, below are some of our priorities for this year
Contact us and/or discuss ideas at https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2017

These are **not** in order of priority

### 1. Tutorials

We have so much good code in [opencv_contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib) that needs better documentation, tutorials, examples of use etc. Particularly:
- Our deep net library, [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/) needs examples of how to
    - Setup, build and run on various OS
    - Training
    - Testing
    - Running on mobile
- DNN - examples of running models learned in Caffe and Torch. Speed tests
- Go over and update/improve/expand on existing tutorials
- Computational Photography
- Tracking
- Camera Calibration
- Video stabilization
- Image stitching

### 2a. Deep learning. Improving OpenCV Deep learning functionality

 OpenCV works with/has an entire deep net library, [tiny-dnn](https://github.com/tiny-dnn/). Or, there is implemented from scratch [DNN module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/dnn). You are welcome to base your proposal on any of these 2 options. We want better performance, more tests, tutorials, python/java wrappers etc.

Improving [DNN module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/dnn) ideas:
- Advanced visualizing of deep learning models (with input-output blobs dimensions, layer types, connections and so on). It can be either based on third-party libraries solution or built on OpenCV's drawing functions own implementation.
- Quantization of convolution and fully-connected layers. These layers are bottlenecks and by speeding them up it's possible to improve performance in many use cases.
- Enable supporting of the most popular deep learning architectures: VGG-16, ResNet, SqueezeNet, R-FCN and so on. Implement missed layers, check output accuracy, write samples for online-available models.
- Optimization of convolution layers - merging operations (Conv + bias + relu + pooing) to give more computation to one thread.

### 2b. Deep learning. Compact models.

 We'd like to learn **compact** (that can be fit on mobile, i.e. models that take a few megabytes of disk or memory space) models ([see SqueezeNet](https://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet) for inspiration that recognize:
- People
- Cars
- Animals, particularly dogs and cats outside and inside.
- Face and/or face features
- Text
- Floors, Walls, Ceilings, Windows, Doors, Tables, Chairs
- Others....

### 3. True, robust checkerboard out of April Tags or Aruco Tags

[April Tags](http://people.csail.mit.edu/kaess/apriltags/), [Aruco Tags](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco)

The code for detecting [Aruco and Charuco](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/aruco) tags needs improvement.

### 4. Working, well-done SLAM

We have tried to get in reliable building blocks for SLAM for years. We've made some projects, but it's not there yet.

Please don't even think about doing this project unless you are already doing SLAM in your advanced PhD work. This is a hard algorithm to get right and you just won't unless you are already a leading expert!

### 5. Improve background subtraction

 We have a Mixture of Guassian (MoG) fitting algorithms that work well, but they fail to take into consideration the correlation between neighbour pixels. Find a better way. We can suggest approaches.

 Extra credit if it can detect or even compensate for camera motion.

### 6. Improve the video stabilization module

 It works well now. Maybe just improve the tutorial, but try to improve the algorithm.

 Try to add deep methods.

### 7. Saliency model

- Improve the saliency relevance
- Improve the application interface (API).

### 8. Text detection

- Improve the text detection module
- Test/improve on other datasets

### 9. Improve data labeling

Write better primitives for marking, segmenting, storing image (and possibly 3D!) data

But maybe just work with and improve the VATIC code (contact authors?)
- https://github.com/cvondrick/vatic
- http://web.mit.edu/vondrick/vatic/

### 10. OpenCV for interaction

- Hand or finger detection
- gesture recognition
- human skeleton based on 2d or 3d

### 11. Improve text recognition speed and accuracy in opencv_contrib/text module.

It would be interesting to adapt the module to use one of the several Deep CNN models have been made public during the last year (both for character and word recognition) e.g. http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/text/. Any other further improvement of the module is also welcome. Last year a DNN has been built that recognizes characters, but it's huge. We are interested in a very compact network (a few megabytes, may be up to 20Mb or so) for character recognition.

### 12. Extend translation of OpenCV into Java script. OpenCV.js

OpenCV.js OpenCV in javascript. Looks very interesting, has huge scale to run vision inside a browser
- https://github.com/ucisysarch
- Examples
    - http://ucisysarch.github.io/opencvjs/examples/img_proc.html
    - http://ucisysarch.github.io/opencvjs/examples/face_detect.html

### 13. Improve 3D visualization for vis

The [vis module](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/viz) is very useful, but it needs:
- Easy way to directly enter cv::Mat containing depth or disparity into a point cloud for vis
- Point cloud to ply converter
- Once in vis, automatic color coded surface normal visualization [see here](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Visualization/ElevationBandsWithGlyphs)
    - And [also here](http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Examples/Cxx/Points/NormalEstimation)
- Tutorials showing how to use its features
    - Add [onto here](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/viz/table_of_content_viz/table_of_content_viz.html)
- Or, maybe we just need to document/improve and bring out functionality [as in docs here](http://www.docs.opencv.org/master/d5/dd8/classcv_1_1viz_1_1WCloudNormals.html)
- Test codes for [functionality are here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/modules/viz/test/tests_simple.cpp)

### 14. Optimizing various stuff

This is very general and always relevant topic. OpenCV is known for decent speed, but there is always room for improvement, especially in the experimental part (opencv_contrib). You are welcome to come up with concrete proposals on optimizing a particular functionality. Optimisation can be done using OpenCL, parallelisation, SSE/AVX or [universal intrinsics](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/hal). It can also be "algorithmic" optimization, which, despite its name, means that the algorithm basically stays the same, but you find some ways to eliminate some unnecessary computations, unnecessary memory allocations etc.

For example, we would be interested in optimizing image processing (imgproc, opencv_contrib/ximgproc), text detection (opencv_contrib/text), TLD tracker (opencv_contrib/tracking), computational photography (photo and opencv_contrib/xphoto), dnn module (opencv_contrib/dnn), feature detectors (features2d and opencv_contrib/xfeatures2d), non-dnn-based object detection (opencv_contrib/dpm and opencv_contrib/xobjdetect). You are welcome to propose for optimization some other functionality, though.

### 15. ROI algebra, improving mask creation and manipulation

Algebra on ROI-s implementing union, intersection, exclusion and more. Have to handle contours, rectangles and circles at least. Proposals are expected to expand on this abstract, come up with a fixed set of methods, be rich enough to justify for a full summer's work and demonstrate their usefulness with examples.

### 16. OpenCV in native Java Script: Opencv.js

A javascript version of OpenCV now has more than 1000 functions.

Yes! OpenCV henceforth will run natively in any browser

Help the authors expand, improve, document and create tutorials for it.

### 17. Halide language

- Optimizing exists algorithms or some parts using Halide.
- Extend implementations for GPU targets.
- Deep learning layers and topologies.
- Automatic domain-specific scheduling.
