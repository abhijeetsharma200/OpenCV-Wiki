Obsolete links
--------------

Main OpenCV repository has been converted to git and compactified. History begins with the famous _"atomic bomb"_ commit which dates back to May 11, 2010 and all prior commits are stored in the separate "OpenCV Attic" repository: https://github.com/opencv/opencv_attic

[Old issue tracker](http://code.opencv.org/projects/opencv/issues) has been moved to read-only state and will be kept for some time.
