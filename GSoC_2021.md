# Ideas:




1. #### _IDEA:_ Create robust visual fiducial tags
   * ***Description:*** Robustly identify standard visual fiducials for April Tags and their orientation. Create a general method of turning a sufficiently textured planar tag into a fiducial that allows for position and ID. 
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * A set of classes and functions that detect the April Tags.
      * Documentation, the regression tests and the samples to describe and demonstrate the implemented functionality.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [AprilTag software under BSD license](https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag). **A note for the future mentors and admins who will integrate the patches. There are LGPL libraries for AprilTag in the net. Please, make sure that the code from the libraries is _not_ used in OpenCV, because OpenCV license is not fully compatible with LGPL.**
   * ***Skills Required:*** Mastery plus experience coding in C++; training and using deep learning; experience with image processing.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Gary Bradski, Gholamreza Amayeh
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Optimize OpenCV for RISC-V
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV provides a convenient method to port many optimized kernels at once to a new CPU, as long as that CPU supports SIMD instructions. We use so-called *Wide Universal Intrinsics* for that. By adding implementation of the wide universal intrinsics for RISC-V we can make OpenCV run pretty efficiently on RISC-V CPUs.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * intrin_riscv.hpp added to `opencv_core` module. It does not have to implement all of the intrinsics. We can start with vector single-precision floating-point arithmetics that would be sufficient for OpenCV DNN acceleration.
      * tweaking OpenCV CMake scripts to let OpenCV cross-compile for RISC-V (Linux OS).
      * make the *wide universal intrinsics* regression tests pass on the software simulator (QEMU)
   * ***Resources:***
      * [Optimizing Tensorflow Lite for RISC-V](https://edge.seas.harvard.edu/files/edge/files/carrv_workshop_submission_2019_camera_ready.pdf)
      * [OpenCV Wide Universal Intrinsics Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html)
      * [Implementation of wide universal intrinsics for various platforms](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/master/modules/core/include/opencv2/core/hal)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; basic skills of optimizing code using SIMD.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vadim Pisarevsky, Alexander Smorkalov
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard



1. #### _IDEA:_ Add Robust Plane/Sphere/Cylinder Fitting into 3D Point Clouds
   * ***Description:*** It's time to start extending OpenCV 3D handling capabilities. One of the important components of 3D Point Cloud processing pipeline is detection of some canonical 3D shapes that make up the cloud. In the urban environments, such as homes, offices, factories, cities, such canonical shapes (planes mostly, sometimes cylinders, occasionally spheres) often occur and they play important role in the 3D scene analysis. In OpenCV we have `opencv_contrib/rgbd` module with some algorithms for 3D cloud processing. Plane, cylinder and sphere fitting would be a useful addition to this set of algorithms.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Add plane fitting into `opencv_contrib/rgbd' module. It should not be just a single plane fitting. It should be segmentation, where the found plane is "subtracted" from the scene and another plane (or other shape) fitting algorithm is applied to the remaining point cloud. Regression test should be added, based on some real or synthetic data.
      * Similarly to the above item, cylinder and sphere fitting should be added as well. In general, we should be able to decompose the scene into a number of planes, cylinders, sheres and the "other" objects.
      * (Optional) Support for non-canonical clusters (based on their compactness, for example) would be nice to have as well.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [A part of Point Cloud Library, which we can probably use as a reference implementation](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl/tree/master/sample_consensus/include/pcl/sample_consensus)
   * ***Skills Required:*** mastery plus experience coding in C++; basic knowledge of 3D point cloud processing principles, model fitting, RANSAC.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Rostislav Vasilikhin, Vadim Pisarevsky
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard

1. #### _IDEA:_ Write a tutorial about training a network in TF or PyTorch and then running it in OpenCV
   * ***Description:*** TensorFlow (TF) and PyTorch are some of the most popular deep learning frameworks. TF exports networks in its own format; PyTorch supports export of the trained models into ONNX format, which is also very popular. OpenCV is becoming quite popular tool for Deep Learning Inference. It would be very useful to describe clearly how to train a model in TF or PyTorch so that it can be then run in OpenCV.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * Write a tutorial that will explain the whole pipeline step by step. Take object detection as the example task. ONNX does not provide all those standard layers for object detection, but OpenCV covers this missing part. Describe it clearly.
      * The tutorial(s) should include some basic information (or a link) how to configure PyTorch/TF, get dataset, train the detection network, and then how to export it to ONNX. Full script should be provided. In the case of TensorFlow it's easier, but still some "finalization" of the network may be needed to run it smoothly with OpenCV.
      * The tutorial(s) should also include description and the whole OpenCV-based example that will read the trained network and will run it on the live video stream from camera.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org)
      * [ONNX](https://onnx.ai)
      * [Object Detection using TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/object_detection/overview)
      * [OpenCV Object Detection Example](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/samples/dnn/object_detection.py). For the tutorial it's too complex. Much simpler one is needed.
   * ***Skills Required:*** good practical experience in DeepLearning, including TF and/or PyTorch. Good Python coding skills. Very good English.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Dmitry Kurtaev, Jia Wu
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ Write a tutorial about using universal intrinsics and `cv::parallel_for_` for efficient cross-platform algorithm implementation
   * ***Description:*** Universal intrinsics is OpenCV way to write cross-platform and yet very efficient code on a variety of platforms. The technique is widely used inside OpenCV, but it's not well-known to many OpenCV users, including contributors, who are supposed to provide high-quality fast code into OpenCV. This tutorial should fill this important missing part of the documentation.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * A tutorial + source code that will explain how to use the universal intrinsics. It should also have an overview of what are intrinsics, what are vector (SIMD) instructions. Some tricks (e.g. how to process the "tails" of image rows that do not fit SIMD register), useful intrinsics should be covered as well.
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV Wide Universal Intrinsics Guide](https://docs.opencv.org/master/df/d91/group__core__hal__intrin.html)
   * ***Skills Required:*** good experience in C++, some experience with code optimization. Very good English.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Vitaly Tuzov, Shiqi Yu
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium

1. #### _IDEA:_ Learn visual fiducial target
   * ***Description:*** OpenCV has several working trackers, based on classical image processing approaches, but we want to add something new, more accurate and fast, based on DNN. We want to jointly learn a fiducial image that allows for accurate localization and orientation of a point across scales
   * ***Expected Outcomes:***
      1. Generate a fiducial image that allows finding it across scales while localizing the center and determining its orientation 
      1. A deepnet that robustly finds the fiducial and accurately determines its orientation and center across scales
   * ***Skills Required:*** Expertise in training deep learning networks training for computer vision problems.
   * ***Mentors:*** ðŸš§ 
   * ***Difficulty:*** Very Hard


1. #### _IDEA:_ Create nuget package for OpenCV and OpenCV contrib.
   * ***Description:*** Nuget is the standard Microsoft package manager. If done properly, it can become the most convenient way to install OpenCV on Windows. We can also create opencv_contrib nuget package, and thus provide a convenient way for OpenCV users to install experimental OpenCV functionality on Windows.
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * scripts to automatically generate 2 nuget packages: for OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib. Probably, even finer-grain nuget packages can be created, e.g. one for the main OpenCV and then one per each opencv_contrib module. But 2 will be good enough to start with.
      * publish OpenCV nuget packages at [NuGet Gallery](nuget.org)
   * ***Resources:***
      * [OpenCV 3.x nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenCV.Net)
      * [An Introduction to NuGet from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/what-is-nuget)
   * ***Skills Required:*** good expertise in C++ and Windows development.
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Satya Mallick
   * ***Difficulty:*** Medium


1. #### _IDEA:_ Support Audio IO module
   * ***Description:*** At the moment, OpenCV can works with inference deep neural network with help DNN module.  But DNN module has limitation, it work with only images. In addition, exist much network which work with audio. That why proposed support audio input/output in OpenCV for  extension functionality of library and more specifically extension functionality of DNN module. 
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** GSoC participant is expected to support audio input/output module for Windows or MacOS family operating system. Will require a study Windows Core Audio APIs (WASAPI) and  MacOS Core Audio.  
   * ***Resources***
        * [WASAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/about-the-windows-core-audio-apis) - Windows audio I/O API.
        * [Core Audio](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MusicAudio/Conceptual/CoreAudioOverview/WhatisCoreAudio/WhatisCoreAudio.html) - MacOS audio I/O API.
    * ***Skills Required:*** experienced in C++, experience in computer vision and OpenCV library.
    * ***Mentors:*** Nesterov Alexander
    * ***Difficulty:*** Medium



1. #### _IDEA:_ Quantization and pruning functionality for OpenCV DNN module 
   * ***Description:*** "Learning compact models for object detection" added  SqueezeDet and SqueezeNet models to OpenCV repository. But OpenCV DNN module is still lacks high-level quantization and pruning functionality. Project also includes implementation of re-training (fine-tuning) of quantized and/or pruned models. 
   * ***Expected Outcomes:*** 
      * 8-bit and 16-bit quantization implementation 
      * Iterative pruning with controlled by target sparsity 
      * Provide examples of quantized and prunned network and fine-tune it (base is AlexNet or other classification architecture) 
      * Provide evaluation of original network and compressed one (accuracy and speed) 
   * ***Additional goals:*** 
      * N-bit quantization 
      * Different operation types as minifloat, dynamic fixed point etc. 
      * Further model compression encoding/decoding with Huffman coding 
   * ***Resources:*** 
         * https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.08342.pdf 
         * https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06440.pdf 
   * ***Skills Required:*** Very good C++ coding skill, experience in Deep Learning area more than just tutorial, basic Computer Vision knowledge, at least some knowledge about quantization and pruning 
   * ***Possible Mentors:*** Tyan Vladimir 
   * ***Difficulty:*** Hard

# **Students**

## **How to Apply**

[Applicaiton process is here](https://opencv.org/google-summer-of-code-internship/)


## **How students will be evaluated once working:**

- Student projects to be paid only if:
    - **Phase 1:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has at least stubbed out _(place holder functions such as just displaying an image)_ functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation ([example tutorial](http://flcwiki.desy.de/How%20to%20document%20your%20code%20using%20doxygen))
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has at least stubbed out unit test
            - Has a stubbed out example/tutorial of use that builds
                 - See [the contribution guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/How_to_contribute)
                 - and [the coding style guild](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Coding_Style_Guide)
                 - the [line_descriptor](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tree/master/modules/line_descriptor) is a good example of student code
    - **Phase 2:**
        - You must generate a pull request
            - That builds
            - Has basic functionality
            - With OpenCV appropriate Doxygen documentation
                - Includes What the function or net is, what the function or net is used for 
            - Has basic unit test
            - Has a tutorial of how to use the function or net and why you'd want to use it.
    - **End of summer:**

            - Full Doxygen documentation
            - A good unit test
            - Example of use/tutorial of the code or net
        - Create a (short!) Movie (preferably on Youtube, but any movie) that demonstrates your code
            - We use this to create an overall summary. Past years:
                - [The 2020 Movie](https://studio.youtube.com/video/9dAMAvh2Em4)
                - [The 2015 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUbUFn71S4s)

                - [The 2013 Movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_TTtN4frMEA)


-----------------

# Mentors:

1.  Contact us by March 15th on the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and ask to be a mentor (or we will ask you in some known cases)
2.  If we accept you, we will post a request from the Google Summer of Code OpenCV project site asking you to join.
3.  You must accept the request and **you are a mentor!**
   * You will also need to get on:
       * ðŸš§ **Complete list**[The Mentor Only Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv_mentors_2021)
       * ðŸš§ [The Student+Mentor Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/opencv-gsoc-2021)
4.  You then:
    - Look through the ideas above, choose one you'd like to mentor or create your own and post it for discussion on the mentor list.
    - Go to the opencv-gsoc googlegroups mailing list above and look through student project proposals and discussions. Discuss the ideas you've chosen. 
       - Find likely students, ask them to apply to your project(s)
    - You will get a list of students who have applied to your project. Go through them and select a student or rejecting them all if none suits and joining to co-mentor or to quit this year are acceptable outcomes.
       - Make sure your students officially apply through the [Google Summer of Code site](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) prior to the deadline as indicate by the Student Application Period in the [time line](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/GSoC_2021#important-dates)
5.  Then, when we get a slot allocation from Google, the administrators *"spend"* the slots in order of priority influenced by whether there's a capable mentor or not for each topic.
6.  Students must finally actually accept to do that project (some sign up for multiple organizations and then choose)
7. Get to work!

**If** you are accepted as a mentor **and** you find a suitable student **and** we give you a slot **and** the student signs up for it, **then** you are an actual mentor! Otherwise you are **not a mentor** and have no other obligations. 
   - Thank you for trying. 
   - You may contact other mentors and co-mentor a project.

You get paid a modest stipend over the summer to mentor, typically $500 minus an org fee of 6%.

Several mentors donate their salary, earning ever better positions in heaven when that comes.
