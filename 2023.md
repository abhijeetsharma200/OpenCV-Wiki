* Vadim:
  * [OpenCV China] GSoC on optical flow: the student and the mentor (Yuantao) have found 2 relatively compact and seemingly efficient models in ONNX format for dense optical flow: RAFT (there are a few variations of it) and DIP. Since they contain some operations that OpenCV DNN does not support now, the first goal is to run them via ONNXRuntime and start working on adding the missing operations to OpenCV.
  * [OpenCV China] GSoC on point cloud compression (2 projects): 1 student is on the sick leave, the other student has prepared PR that adds support for colored point clouds I/O.
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao extracted gemm code from Ficus. It runs ~3-4x faster than the original code from BLISLab. The first PR that puts this fast GEMM into OpenCV should be ready by the next week.
  * [OpenCV China] All FP32 models in OpenCV model zoo have been converted to FP16. Seem to work well and take ~2x less space.
  * Vadim has mostly finished work on adding 1D/0D mat support (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23473). There are few minor remaining issues, but they will be resolved right before merging this patch to 5.x (after 4.8.0 is released, PR #23718 is integrated and #23473 is rebased on the latest 5.x).
  * Vadim has started resumed work, started by Zihao Mu, on adding CV_32U, CV_64U, CV_64S, CV_Bool and CV_16BF into OpenCV. Currently working on extending core module and the respective tests to cover those new types. 
* Vincent:
  * TBD
* Shiqi Yu:
  * OpenCV China will organize OpenCV summer school at end of July, 2 days long; expected to have ~50 participants.
  * Jia has finished book on using OpenCV with Python.
  * Gary and Satya attended CVPR 2023. Unfortunately, Shiqi could not get visa.
* Vladimir D:
  * Finished migration of barcode detector to the main repository; it will become a part of OpenCV 4.8.0.
  * Maksym Shabunin started working on improving solvePoly, to make the initialization more robust.
  * OpenCV summer of code, RISC-V acceleration project: some PRs to OpenCV are expected soon.
* Dmitry Matveev (Intel):
  * Asked about handling security issues when using OpenCV in production: security@opencv.org is the channel to report such issues.
  * Anatoly has found some problems in Python bindings for G-API, but it will be addressed after the release.
  * There are performance issues with G-API-related GSoC projects, will try to communicate to the students.
* Alexander S (opencv.ai):
  * Abduragim Shtanchaev:
    * on vacation
  * Alexander Panov:
    * Checked issue cv2.findChessboardCorners() running endlessly on certain images [#23558](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/23558)
      * The problems in the algorithm were found and described in the issue
    * Checked issue Doesn't correctly recognize some QR [#21417](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/21417)
      * The problem in the algorithm was found, decodeMulti() and decode() work differently in QRCodeDetector
    * Wrong shape of Python Aruco dictionary bytesList? [#1939](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues?      q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+1939)
      * described problem in the issue, docs update is being prepared
    * Reviewed PR Aruco MIP dictionary [#23785](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23785) was merged
    * Prepared PR Fix segfault in QRCodeDetector.detectAndDecodeCurved [#23802](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23802). Added test, added “hack” solution. Works on splines parametrization now. 
  * Alexander Smorkalov:
    * Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues with ##23799, 22798, 23825, 23812, 23807, 23796, 23786
    * Extended JS bindings for bar code detector (23819). Fixed bar code detector build without dnn (23819).

* Vadim:
  * [OpenCV China]
    * There are some fixes for using OpenMP on macOS.
    * Some further significant acceleration of transformers in OpenCV DNN is expected soon (after Chinese New Year)
    * The work on Vulkan backend of OpenCV DNN is going on
* Gary:
  * Get ready for GSoC 2023 application: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023
  * Talked with some companies who extended their sponsorship for another year.
  * Reviewed submissions for the OpenCV competition.
  * Started investigating open NeRF idea.
* Shiqi Yu:
  * Reviewed all the submissions for OpenCV competition. The winners have been selected and will be announced shortly (likely tomorrow)
* Alexander S (xperience.ai):
  * Done:
    * Rostislav Vasilikhin:
      * nanMask PR: done & ready for review
      * OCL implementation
      * 1-channel version vectorized
      * cvIsInf(double) bug: found, fixed, backported to 3.4 in PR [#23145](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23145)
      * Tests: parametric test for flags, random Infs and NaNs, reference calculation with SoftFloat
      * stddev calib: fixed 5.x and 3.4 branches
      * USAC fix: updated to remove any code except the fix
    * Alexander Smorkalov:
      * Reviewed, tested, helped to resolve issues: 23141, 22884, 23098, 23145, 23139
      * Debugged OpenCV-Python API issue with zlib. Works on solution and release.
    * Sergei Shutov:
      * Tested all available datasets with OpenCV multicam calibration tool and compared them to Kalibr results (distances + MeshLab renders). In most cases the new OpenCV calibration engine achieves comparable results (hoorray!), but there are few cases where results are not that good. Currently Sergei is preparing proper test cases to reproduce (and then fix) the detected problems.
      * Updated script to load intrinsic parameters from xml files and pairwise distance calculation
      * Fixed a bug with saving results is multiview calibration script (non-homogeneous numpy data)
      * Implemented OpenCV calibration result rendering with meshlab
    * Alexander Panov:
      * Prepared PR add python charuco sample [#23139](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23139) 
      * Prepared PR fix charuco matchImagePoints [#23138](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23138) 
      * Prepared PR remove charuco duplication [#3420](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/pull/3420) 
      * Commented issue Charuco marker pose estimation -> Z-axis in wrong direction [#755](https://github.com/opencv/opencv-  python/issues/755)
    * In progress:
      * Alexander Panov:
        * preparing QR code detect with ArUco algs. It appears that ArUco algorithms can be applied with some modification for QR code detection and the achieved so-far results are very, very promising.
      * Rostislav Vasilikhin:
        * Porting [#22519](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22519) to 5.x
        * Extend USAC: analyzing similar existing functionality
      * Sergei Shutov:
        * Compiling calibration and issue reports

## 2023-01-11

* Vadim:
  * Paused work on the new version of OpenCV 5 DNN engine.
  * Started working on adding the proper 1D and 0D mat support in OpenCV, and also on adding support for other data types (bool, int64/uint64, uint32, bfloat16, ...)
* Stefano:
  * Currently no connection with OpenCV, just a few updates, especially on PlainML (joint work with Intel):
    * https://github.com/plaidml/tpp-mlir.
    * https://github.com/openxla/community. 
    * prepared some nice demo of stable diffusion at CES2023: https://nod.ai/sd-rdna3-ces2023/.
* Gary:
  * Just got back from vacation. Some negotiations going on; will hopefully have some of the gold OpenCV sponsors to renew/extend the contract.
* Shiqi:
  * OpenCV Competition: 45 submissions. All the submissions have been reviewed. A few submissions are really brilliant. Have some home work to do before the next competition to provide more detailed instructions how to present the results, which will hopefully increase the number of good submissions.
  * Let's plan joint face-to-face OpenCV meeting during 2023 Spring; the date and place to be discussed separately.
* Alexander S (xperience.ai):
  * OpenCV 4.7.0 has been released. Big thanks to OpenCV team @ Yadro (Alexander Alekhin in particular).
  * Rostislav:
    * Stddev calibration issue: found similar issue in omnidir calibration, opened issues [#23057]  (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/23057) and [#3406@contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues/3406)
    * Extend USAC: rewrote Umeyama algorithm so that it’s easy to read, +20% faster and can be potentially vectorized. PR approved although weights are not checked (can be fixed in next PRs)
    * Found a bug in USAC (dense matrix allocation), fixed by [#23073](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23073)
    * Stddev calibration issue: total variable in stddev calculation should be 2x bigger (as it's said in MVG book), the denominator correction is OK (Vadim confirms + lamm45 confirms + MVG explains)
    * Fixing PR’s done, backported & squashed: [#22992](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22992) to 5.x, [#22996](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22996) to 4.x, [#23025](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23025) to 3.4
    * Looks like fisheye calibration has the same problem with stddevs as the usual calibration, see [this comment](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/19803#issuecomment-1364448305), need to investigate all calibration in OpenCV
      * Fisheye aspect ratio issue:
    * PR fixes aspect ratio calculation, enables Java test, ground truth values & wrong test behavior (rewriting testdata), halves test    images to fit into patch size checker
    * Backported: [#22604](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22604) to 4.x + [#1028@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1028) (merged), [#23023](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23023) has been replaced by    [#23029](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23029) to 3.4 + [#1030@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1030) (merged), [#23027](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23027) to 5.x + [#1029@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1029)
