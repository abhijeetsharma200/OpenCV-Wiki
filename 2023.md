    * Some further significant acceleration of transformers in OpenCV DNN is expected soon (after Chinese New Year)
    * The work on Vulkan backend of OpenCV DNN is going on
* Gary:
  * Get ready for GSoC 2023 application: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2023
  * Talked with some companies who extended their sponsorship for another year.
  * Reviewed submissions for the OpenCV competition.
  * Started investigating open NeRF idea.
* Shiqi Yu:
  * Reviewed all the submissions for OpenCV competition. The winners have been selected and will be announced shortly (likely tomorrow)
* Alexander S (xperience.ai):
  * Done:
    * Rostislav Vasilikhin:
      * nanMask PR: done & ready for review
      * OCL implementation
      * 1-channel version vectorized
      * cvIsInf(double) bug: found, fixed, backported to 3.4 in PR [#23145](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23145)
      * Tests: parametric test for flags, random Infs and NaNs, reference calculation with SoftFloat
      * stddev calib: fixed 5.x and 3.4 branches
      * USAC fix: updated to remove any code except the fix
    * Alexander Smorkalov:

      * Debugged OpenCV-Python API issue with zlib. Works on solution and release.
    * Sergei Shutov:
      * Tested all available datasets with OpenCV multicam calibration tool and compared them to Kalibr results (distances + MeshLab renders). In most cases the new OpenCV calibration engine achieves comparable results (hoorray!), but there are few cases where results are not that good. Currently Sergei is preparing proper test cases to reproduce (and then fix) the detected problems.
      * Updated script to load intrinsic parameters from xml files and pairwise distance calculation
      * Fixed a bug with saving results is multiview calibration script (non-homogeneous numpy data)

        * preparing QR code detect with ArUco algs. It appears that ArUco algorithms can be applied with some modification for QR code detection and the achieved so-far results are very, very promising.
      * Rostislav Vasilikhin:
        * Porting [#22519](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22519) to 5.x
        * Extend USAC: analyzing similar existing functionality

        * Compiling calibration and issue reports

## 2023-01-11

* Vadim:
  * Paused work on the new version of OpenCV 5 DNN engine.
  * Started working on adding the proper 1D and 0D mat support in OpenCV, and also on adding support for other data types (bool, int64/uint64, uint32, bfloat16, ...)
* Stefano:
  * Currently no connection with OpenCV, just a few updates, especially on PlainML (joint work with Intel):
    * https://github.com/plaidml/tpp-mlir.
    * https://github.com/openxla/community. 
    * prepared some nice demo of stable diffusion at CES2023: https://nod.ai/sd-rdna3-ces2023/.
* Gary:
  * Just got back from vacation. Some negotiations going on; will hopefully have some of the gold OpenCV sponsors to renew/extend the contract.
* Shiqi:
  * OpenCV Competition: 45 submissions. All the submissions have been reviewed. A few submissions are really brilliant. Have some home work to do before the next competition to provide more detailed instructions how to present the results, which will hopefully increase the number of good submissions.
  * Let's plan joint face-to-face OpenCV meeting during 2023 Spring; the date and place to be discussed separately.
* Alexander S (xperience.ai):
  * OpenCV 4.7.0 has been released. Big thanks to OpenCV team @ Yadro (Alexander Alekhin in particular).
  * Rostislav:
    * Stddev calibration issue: found similar issue in omnidir calibration, opened issues [#23057]  (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/23057) and [#3406@contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues/3406)
    * Extend USAC: rewrote Umeyama algorithm so that it’s easy to read, +20% faster and can be potentially vectorized. PR approved although weights are not checked (can be fixed in next PRs)
    * Found a bug in USAC (dense matrix allocation), fixed by [#23073](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23073)
    * Stddev calibration issue: total variable in stddev calculation should be 2x bigger (as it's said in MVG book), the denominator correction is OK (Vadim confirms + lamm45 confirms + MVG explains)
    * Fixing PR’s done, backported & squashed: [#22992](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22992) to 5.x, [#22996](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22996) to 4.x, [#23025](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23025) to 3.4
    * Looks like fisheye calibration has the same problem with stddevs as the usual calibration, see [this comment](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/19803#issuecomment-1364448305), need to investigate all calibration in OpenCV
      * Fisheye aspect ratio issue:
    * PR fixes aspect ratio calculation, enables Java test, ground truth values & wrong test behavior (rewriting testdata), halves test    images to fit into patch size checker
    * Backported: [#22604](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22604) to 4.x + [#1028@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1028) (merged), [#23023](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23023) has been replaced by    [#23029](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23029) to 3.4 + [#1030@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1030) (merged), [#23027](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23027) to 5.x + [#1029@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1029)
