## 2023-01-11

* Vadim:
  * Paused work on the new version of OpenCV 5 DNN engine.
  * Started working on adding the proper 1D and 0D mat support in OpenCV, and also on adding support for other data types (bool, int64/uint64, uint32, bfloat16, ...)
* Stefano:
  * Currently no connection with OpenCV, just a few updates, especially on PlainML (joint work with Intel):
    * https://github.com/plaidml/tpp-mlir.
    * https://github.com/openxla/community. 
    * prepared some nice demo of stable diffusion at CES2023: https://nod.ai/sd-rdna3-ces2023/.
* Gary:
  * Just got back from vacation. Some negotiations going on; will hopefully have some of the gold OpenCV sponsors to renew/extend the contract.
* Shiqi:
  * OpenCV Competition: 45 submissions. All the submissions have been reviewed. A few submissions are really brilliant. Have some home work to do before the next competition to provide more detailed instructions how to present the results, which will hopefully increase the number of good submissions.
  * Let's plan joint face-to-face OpenCV meeting during 2023 Spring; the date and place to be discussed separately.
* Alexander S (x.ai):
  * OpenCV 4.7.0 has been released. Big thanks to OpenCV team @ Yadro (Alexander Alekhin in particular).
  * Rostislav:
    * Stddev calibration issue: found similar issue in omnidir calibration, opened issues [#23057]  (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/23057) and [#3406@contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues/3406)
    * Extend USAC: rewrote Umeyama algorithm so that it’s easy to read, +20% faster and can be potentially vectorized. PR approved although weights are not checked (can be fixed in next PRs)
    * Found a bug in USAC (dense matrix allocation), fixed by [#23073](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23073)
    * Stddev calibration issue: total variable in stddev calculation should be 2x bigger (as it's said in MVG book), the denominator correction is OK (Vadim confirms + lamm45 confirms + MVG explains)
    * Fixing PR’s done, backported & squashed: [#22992](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22992) to 5.x, [#22996](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22996) to 4.x, [#23025](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23025) to 3.4
    * Looks like fisheye calibration has the same problem with stddevs as the usual calibration, see [this comment](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/19803#issuecomment-1364448305), need to investigate all calibration in OpenCV
      * Fisheye aspect ratio issue:
    * PR fixes aspect ratio calculation, enables Java test, ground truth values & wrong test behavior (rewriting testdata), halves test    images to fit into patch size checker
    * Backported: [#22604](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22604) to 4.x + [#1028@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1028) (merged), [#23023](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23023) has been replaced by    [#23029](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23029) to 3.4 + [#1030@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1030) (merged), [#23027](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23027) to 5.x + [#1029@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1029)
  * Sergei:
    * Aruco tutorials: fixed tutorial code, text, links and snippets, check it with opencv without contrib, prepared PR in main repo and contrib.
    * Investigate multi camera calibration: build opencv 5.x (PR #22363) and study files in PR; Build doxygen docs and read multiview camera calibration tutorial up to algorithm implementation details.
    * Aruco tutorials: fixed tutorial links and snippets, check it with opencv without contrib, prepared PR in main repo.
    * Reviewed PR #23012 (tried only with cuda 11.8)
    * Update charuco tutorials and sample code in contrib repo and created PR #3407
  * Alexander Smorkalov:
    * Released OpenCV and OpenCV Python
    * Updated Python build scripts for FFmpeg 5.x, Python 3.11 support
    * Re-implemented Board class and children for Aruco-based boards in PR #22986.
  * Vacations
    * Alexander Panov:
