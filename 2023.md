## 2023-11-15

* Vadim:
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao has submitted patch to support HardSwish, LayerNorm, InstanceNorm etc. in CANN backend of DNN. This is to support some new models, including vittrack for object tracking.
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao continues working on transformer acceleration, he is now implementing fused multi-head Attention block.
  * [OpenCV China] Wanli reviewed convolution kernels used in various computer vision models, including various flavours of depth-wise convolution. He will submit PR with the respective performance tests for DNN.
  * resumed work on the patches by Zihao Mu to accelerate FP16 and INT8 convolution. Hopefully, will finish it this week.
* Vladimir:
  * finished RISC-V testing on real hardware; added respective information to OpenCV wiki: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/OpenCV-RISC-V. Lichi Pi supports RVV 0.7.1. Support for RVV 1.0 is coming.
  * Maksym fixed a few test failures in 5.x branch: https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/24517.
  * continue to work on outliers (functions that run very slow on RISC-V with RVV). In particular, fixed color conversion RGB<=>BGR.
* Vincent:
  * found some potential problems with memory in warp affine/warp perspetive. Will provide fix.
  * tried opencv 4.9.0-pre internally, compiles and runs well. Found one issue with 5.0-pre - some Python samples fail.
* Shiqi Yu:
  * OpenCV training is over. It was about using robotic arm (by Elephant Robotics) + depth camera by Orbbec; Aruco codes have been used for locating hand in space. There have been 45 participants. Wu Jia presented materials, and it was followed by the practical session.
* Dmitry:
  * working on PR with multi-object tracking support in G-API.
  * documentation on G-API is going to be improved as well.
* Gary:
  * the campaign is going on, but it's a bit slow; ~7% of expected money have been collected so far. Continue to explore possible ways of funding dev team beyond just this campaign.
* Alexander S (opencv.ai):
  * TBD

## 2023-11-08

* Vadim:
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao did more testing of CANN-based OpenCV acceleration; the patch has been modified by our request, it does not modify Input/OutputArray any longer. Will do further testing in a cloud on Ascend 710 devices.
  * [OpenCV China] there was request to port instanceNormalization layer to OpenCL. Tried to do it on ARM-based mac, but found that DNN on macOS does not support OpenCL backend. Will try to re-enable it.
  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao continues work on attention block optimization. Looks like we will still need batch matmul.
  * [OpenCV China] Wanli continues to explore convolution operations. Will add more perf tests soon.
* Shiqi Yu (OpenCV China):
  * no updates this week. Preparing for the OpenCV+robotics offline 1-day course (this Saturday).
* Vincent:
  * tried the latest OpenCV (4.9.0-pre). There are some modifications observed in Python bindings, some weird behaviour of functions that take InputOutputArray, e.g. drawing functions. Will take a look at it in more details and report bug if it's confirmed.
  * oss fuzz-based testing of libavif-based image codec in OpenCV has been prepared.
  * will prepare next patches for cv::resize(...,INTER_AREA) optimization. Should bring another 20% (!) or so acceleration.
  * took the first look at G-API, see how it can be useful for massive image processing.
  * suggested to 
* Vladimir:
  * a few fixes in gstreamer-based video i/o backend have been merged.
  * audio processing functionality in opencv_contrib: doing some activities, will prepare PR later.
  * working on enabling RISC-V+RVV0.7.1 in OpenCV CI (using physical board).
  * looking at the outliers in performance curve on RISC-V. Raw data and S-curves (perf scalar vs vector) for x64, aarch64 and riscv64 available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aDOZN-uYuWcvT7U7JCWHMRw28fk4FuHb).
* Dmitry M (Intel):
  * 'image == scalar' in Python seems to behave differently from C++.
  * Q: shall we target G-API patches to 4.x or 5.x? A: it depends. bug fixes and optimizations should go to 4.x, major new features should target 5.x.
* Gary:
  * fundraising on OpenCV 5 has started: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/opencv-5-support-non-profit-open-source-cv-ai#/

  * Alexander Panov:
    * Worked on the issue Issue “aruco.detectMarkers() fails at a certain angle while the image is perfect [#24220](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/24220)”. Prepared new filtering algorithm for ArUco. This algorithm fixes:
    * multiple detection of a single marker;
    * incorrect work with nested contours (issue [#24220](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/24220));
    * detection charuco with big markers (big relative to the board cell)
    * Tested new filtering algorithm for ArUco in synthetic benchmark with marker length rate = 0.8
    * Detected markers up from 95% to 100%
    * Error statistics for the new and the old algorithm (error in 10 pixels corresponds to not detected markers) looks very good.

## 2023-09-20

* Vadim:
  * almost finished 1D/0D patch. The patch to main opencv repo has passed CI already, contrib is still in progress; found that cuda* modules are super-slow to compile. Suggest to replace many of the manually written cuda kernels with calls to NVidia NPP: 1) OpenCV already calls some NPP functions 2) it should be more relevant and easier-to-support solution 3) compile speed should increase significantly, the size of binaries should decrease.

## 2023-07-26

* Vadim:
  * will be on vacation on August 4th-27th.
  * Working on refreshing proposal on OpenCV 5.0 DNN module: scope, prioritized list of features, task decomposition.
  * No progress with the patches to add new data types and to add 0d/1d support; hope to finalize them within 1-2 weeks.

  * [OpenCV China] Yuantao has submitted PR with a popular numpy operation: broadcastTo(): . Need to review. Vadim has suggested to look at Expand implementation in Ficus NN, which implements similar (or even same) operation, but probably in more efficient way. Also, it would be nice to extend our implementation of binary operations to do broadcasting implictly, without creating explicit broadcasted copy of some of arguments.
  * [OpenCV China] Wanli will work on reintegration of ONNX conformance suite into OpenCV DNN unit tests. We need to be able to measure ONNX coverage.

## 2023-06-21

* Vadim:
  * [OpenCV China] GSoC on optical flow: the student and the mentor (Yuantao) have found 2 relatively compact and seemingly efficient models in ONNX format for dense optical flow: RAFT (there are a few variations of it) and DIP. Since they contain some operations that OpenCV DNN does not support now, the first goal is to run them via ONNXRuntime and start working on adding the missing operations to OpenCV.
  * [OpenCV China] GSoC on point cloud compression (2 projects): 1 student is on the sick leave, the other student has prepared PR that adds support for colored point clouds I/O.
