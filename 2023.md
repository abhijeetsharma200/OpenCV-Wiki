* Vadim:
  * TBD
* Vincent:
  * TBD
* Alexander S (x.ai):
  * Rostislav:
    * Stddev calibration issue: found similar issue in omnidir calibration, opened issues [#23057]  (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/23057) and [#3406@contrib](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues/3406)
    * Extend USAC: rewrote Umeyama algorithm so that it’s easy to read, +20% faster and can be potentially vectorized. PR approved although weights are not checked (can be fixed in next PRs)
    * Found a bug in USAC (dense matrix allocation), fixed by [#23073](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23073)
    * Stddev calibration issue: total variable in stddev calculation should be 2x bigger (as it's said in MVG book), the denominator correction is OK (Vadim confirms + lamm45 confirms + MVG explains)
    * Fixing PR’s done, backported & squashed: [#22992](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22992) to 5.x, [#22996](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22996) to 4.x, [#23025](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23025) to 3.4
    * Looks like fisheye calibration has the same problem with stddevs as the usual calibration, see [this comment](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/19803#issuecomment-1364448305), need to investigate all calibration in OpenCV
      * Fisheye aspect ratio issue:
    * PR fixes aspect ratio calculation, enables Java test, ground truth values & wrong test behavior (rewriting testdata), halves test    images to fit into patch size checker
    * Backported: [#22604](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/22604) to 4.x + [#1028@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1028) (merged), [#23023](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23023) has been replaced by    [#23029](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23029) to 3.4 + [#1030@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1030) (merged), [#23027](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/pull/23027) to 5.x + [#1029@extra](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_extra/pull/1029)
  * Sergei:
    * Aruco tutorials: fixed tutorial code, text, links and snippets, check it with opencv without contrib, prepared PR in main repo and contrib.
    * Investigate multi camera calibration: build opencv 5.x (PR #22363) and study files in PR; Build doxygen docs and read multiview camera calibration tutorial up to algorithm implementation details.
    * Aruco tutorials: fixed tutorial links and snippets, check it with opencv without contrib, prepared PR in main repo.
    * Reviewed PR #23012 (tried only with cuda 11.8)
    * Update charuco tutorials and sample code in contrib repo and created PR #3407
  * Alexander Smorkalov:
    * Released OpenCV and OpenCV Python
    * Updated Python build scripts for FFmpeg 5.x, Python 3.11 support
    * Re-implemented Board class and children for Aruco-based boards in PR #22986.
  * Vacations
    * Alexander Panov:
